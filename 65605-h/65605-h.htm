<p>It is with some temerity that the author, a geologist by training
and an interpretive naturalist by occupation, undertakes to compile
this booklet on Indians who once inhabited the vicinity of Lassen
Peak.</p>
<p>The main mission of a naturalist, as he functions in the National
Park Service, is to act as an interpreter of technical information
gathered together by research scientists. It is his obligation as
well as his privilege to make these data of history and natural
history available for visitors to units administered by the National
Park Service of the United States Department of the Interior. The
Park Naturalist is challenged to create in visitors an eager interest
by presenting information in an appealing manner so that the great
stories of the respective areas may be learned easily and
pleasantly. In doing this, visitors gain fuller understanding and
hence better appreciation of the significance of these areas. This
leads to greater enjoyment of the scenic masterpieces, the scientific
natural wonders, and the historic shrines of areas of the
National Park System. Not only is the visitor&rsquo;s enjoyment enhanced
by his active reception of the interpretive facilities and services
offered him by the Federal Government, but his pride is stimulated
in these areas which have been set aside for his own use as well
as for the benefit of future generations. A citizen&rsquo;s pride in his
park areas in turn develops a love of country. It also promotes a
sense of responsibility which helps the National Park Service fight
vandalism, fire carelessness, and litter carelessness to the ultimate
benefit of all concerned.</p>
<p>Little on the pages which follow may be classed as original
material for it is in the role of interpreter that the undersigned has
assembled information gleaned by qualified students.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;Amerind&rdquo; instead of the traditional word &ldquo;Indian&rdquo;
was seriously considered for use in this book but finally rejected.
Ever since Christopher Columbus&rsquo; historic mistake the word Indian
has had a confusing two-fold meaning. Columbus, of course, thought
that he had been successful in reaching India when his little fleet
touched the shores of the New World. Hence he applied the word
Indian to the people he found there, supposing them to be natives
of India. The term Amerind is a coined contraction of the words:
American Indian. The use of Amerind has been advocated by some
authors to do away with confusion, and it does seem to be an
excellent name, but it has not enjoyed wide usage by the American
public.</p>

research and learned writings have provided the bulk of the information
contained in the present publication. The bibliography carries

<p>Properly, specific credit should be given in the text for each
fact and quotation taken from the works of others, but the result
would in this case have been unwieldy and of no practical benefit
to the readers whom this book is intended to reach. It is hoped
that professional ethnologists into whose hands this volume may
fall will forgive this unorthodox usage of the research results of
serious students.</p>
<p>Mrs. Selina La Marr (Boonookoo-ee-menorra) was a valuable

<br />PREHISTORIC MAN COMES TO NORTH AMERICA</h2>
<p>Archeological studies of human remains from all over the world
have shown beyond serious question that man originated in the
Eastern Hemisphere about a million years ago. Meager remnants
of prehistoric skeletons of man and his tools, hearths, and debris
heaps have been found in deposits of late Cenozoic time, Chapter
Five of earth&rsquo;s history. This late Cenozoic period starting about
a million years ago is called the Pleistocene or Ice Age. These
discoveries show the orderly processes of survival of the fittest
and of evolution developing successive generations of man with
refined physical and mental qualities, ultimately producing modern
man.</p>
<p>During the Ice Age there were four separate times during which
ice formation on all continents of the earth increased tremendously.
Just what caused changes in climate to make this possible is not
definitely known. Slight changes in amount of carbon dioxide in
the air, which could have been affected by the amount of volcanic
activity or by major changes in the amount of plant life in existence,
may have affected the climate. Slight variations in the
orbit of the earth in its course around the sun may also have had
their influence. Even today it would require a drop of only a few
degrees in the average annual temperature of the earth&rsquo;s climate
to produce a large increase in ice formation. All that is required
is that a little more snow falls each winter than will melt in the
summer. Thus, each year the excess would gradually build up
glaciers and continental ice sheets, producing another &ldquo;ice stage&rdquo;
in a few thousands of years.</p>
<p>The area of ice in the world today is relatively small: under
6 million square miles, about the same as that existing during each
of the four interglacial (warm climate) stages of the Pleistocene.
During the four glacial stages of the Ice Age, continental ice sheets
increased their areas by three or four times, also becoming larger
in size in each successive cold cycle. The latest and most extensive
of these glacial times, the Wisconsin Stage, actually saw
two ice advances with a brief recession separating them about
60,000 years ago.</p>
<p>During each glacial stage tremendous amounts of water were
removed from the oceans and deposited on the continents as ice
fields. This involved amounts of as much as 20 million cubic miles
of water, causing world-wide lowering of sea level of about 150 or
200 feet. Today the sea between Alaska and Siberia is very
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
shallow. It is not difficult to realize that lowered sea level during
the glacial stages of the ice age drained the water from this and
other shallow sea floors exposing these as land links or &ldquo;land
bridges&rdquo; which extended between continents and islands. This
state of affairs made possible the overland migration of man to the
Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>In his illuminating paper &ldquo;Early Relations of Man to Plants&rdquo;
Sauer has pointed out that early man&rsquo;s migrations to the New World
were not the result of mere aimless wanderings. Peking Man of the
first interglacial stage about 900,000 years ago in Asia used fire in
established hearths. He ate both cooked meats and vegetables.
This evidence indicates at least a semi-sedentary family life.
Since he had learned to make himself more comfortable generally
by remaining in one favorable place, it follows logically that even
primitive Peking Man migrated only when he could improve his lot
by doing so. He moved on only when he was forced to do so by a
failing food supply or because of crowded conditions caused by
increasing numbers of his fellow men. It is believed that not only
Peking Man, but his descendants were as sedentary as their food
supply allowed them to be. Dr. Sauer observes that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;... the history of human population (numbers) is a succession
of higher and higher levels, each rise to a new level
being brought about by the discovery of more food either
through occupation of a new territory or through increase in
food producing skill.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The invention of a better tool, improved food preparation, discovery
of new foods, better storage, or utilization would bring about
this increase in food availability.</p>
<p>Apparently the twin circumstances of the need for more food and
the existence of a dry land connection between Asia and North
America enabled a series of migrations of prehistoric men to the
New World. The migrations did not occur just during one glacial
stage, nor during the last 15 or 25,000 years as some have claimed,
but continued interruptedly over a period of many thousands of
years. Perhaps such migrations started as long ago as 300,000
years&mdash;whenever land connections permitted and other conditions
warranted. As a result, we find a number of stocks of Old World
Man at various levels of cultural development coming into the
Americas. Naturally a variety of plant and animal species migrated
in both directions between the Old and New Worlds of their own
accord, in addition to those which might have been brought along
by prehistoric man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>A classic example of plant migration to the New World is that
of California&rsquo;s celebrated redwoods. In China just a few years
ago the little changed ancestors of these trees, the still-growing
Metasequoia were discovered. In rocks of the most recent era
(Chapter Five of earth&rsquo;s history) the step by step migration of the
changing redwood ancestors can be followed by studying successively
younger rock layers in Siberia, Alaska, and in Canada
and northwest United States. These relics and imprints of the
foliage, fruits, and even of wood texture of these ancient trees
were covered by sands and muds, and thus preserved in stone as
fossils. This has made it possible to identify the ancestral redwood
species and to demonstrate their march to California. It is
interesting to note how the redwoods changed in the process, evolving
by degrees to cope with new conditions of climate and soil
during their slow migrations. At length today two distinct and
unique Sequoias are to be found living only in California. One,
the Coast Redwood, has adapted itself to coastal fogs and reproduction
by sprouting root shoots. The other, restricted to drier areas
of the west slope of the Sierra, the Sierra Redwood or Big Tree,
has its needles reduced to small scales to withstand the drier
climate, and reproduces only by seed.</p>
<p>Sauer observes that the stone implements of prehistoric man are
the best preserved relics of his culture and are the most easily
found. Unfortunately the less durable and less easily recognized
relics of skin, bone, wood, and vegetable fibers which are equally
or often even more important clues to the past, have been altered
beyond recognition or completely destroyed. As a result these
disappeared or their camouflaged remnants have been overlooked
and passed unrecognized by even careful students seeking to learn
the details of this fascinating story of the how&rsquo;s and why&rsquo;s and
when&rsquo;s of your ancestors and mine in Europe and also of the Indians
in Asia and in North America in general, and of those of the Lassen
area in particular.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">Chapter II</span>
<br />EARLY CULTURES IN NORTH AMERICA</h2>
<p>The fact that skeletons of primitive forms of man have so far
not been discovered in the Western Hemisphere does not mean that
ancestral forms preceding modern man did not migrate to the New
World in remote times. It is that erroneous idea which has caused
some persons to reason that man arrived here only in the final
glacial stage. Good evidence has been presented to suggest that
the sites he would have been most likely to inhabit might be submerged
at present or may have been especially vulnerable to
destruction by erosion.</p>
<p>Certain primitive peoples of the New World (in South America)
do no boiling of foods and do not have the dog, indicating very
early immigration from the Old World. Dr. Sauer suggests a date
during the third glacial stage, the Kansan, about 300,000 years
ago instead of the Wisconsin Glacial Stage of 15,000 or 25,000
years ago as some have contended.</p>
<p>At the present level of archeological and paleontological knowledge
of prehistoric man in North America, Sauer recognizes five
basic early cultures. These are listed below in the order of their
apparent appearances in the New World.</p>
<p>The most primitive and oldest culture of man recognized to date
is very difficult to detect, for its evidences were of a fragile nature.
Few traces of it remain to be seen today. This first culture known
in North America lacks both stone weapon points and grinding
stones. These items were also found lacking in the cultures of
some isolated contemporary peoples of both North and South
America.</p>
<p>The second oldest culture in North America was that of the
Ancient Food Grinders which appears to have been widespread in
the rather rainy climate of the Mississippi and Pacific regions of
North America. These people built fireplaces or hearths&mdash;beds
of collected stones. They used a grinding slab of stone on which
a handstone was rubbed to crush hard seeds. This indicates a
greater variety of foods than used in the earlier culture. A number
of crude pounding tools such as choppers and scrapers were employed
as were a few rude knives of stone. It is of interest and
significance that use of the grinder and grinding slab disappeared
completely from most or all of this area later. The well known
metate and mano grinding devices of the Southwest were introduced
much later, along with the growing of corn or maize, from the Central
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
American region. Coiled basketry appears to be identified with
this second culture too, such articles being essential as containers
for collection of seeds, winnowing, et cetera. Studies of the
evidence in the field show also that these peoples were sedentary
to the extent of developing refuse mounds or middens. The fact
that this culture is not found in Europe or in Asia indicates that
it developed in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>About 35,000 years ago the third culture appears to have developed.
It was one in which hunting was of major importance.
These hunters were not nomads, however, for the building of hearths,
accumulations of artifacts, and also the general use of seed grinding
stones, all indicate rather sedentary habits. This culture is
characterized by the presence of dart or spear throwers, an invention
of European origin. This indicates more recent migrations
from the Old World. These darts were stone tipped and propelled
with a spear thrower or atlatl, making hunting of animal food much
more effective than in the case of earlier cultures.</p>
<p>The fourth culture is that known by the names Folsom and Yuma.
In these people interest in plant foods and fibers was slight, for
this was primarily a mobile hunting culture. The people were not
sedentary, but moved around.</p>
<p>Well after the disappearance of the glaciers of the Ice Age, late
comers from the Old World brought a fifth culture to the Americas.
These people used the bow and arrow with its small and finely
worked stone point. Fish hooks were used and many stone implements
were well polished. This too is the first culture of the New
World with which the dog was associated.</p>
<p>In Eastern North America, and particularly well known in the
Southwest, are abundant archeological evidences from easily recognized
prehistoric living sites. These reveal a succession of more
recent cultures and changes within cultures, as well as movement
of early peoples. In contrast there are relatively few recognized
prehistoric sites in California which tell much about early customs
and material culture of aboriginal man. Some productive areas
which have been found are notably the following: The Farmington
Reservoir area of Stanislaus County more than 4,000 years old&mdash;possibly
much older, Kingsley Cave, the Santa Barbara area, and
the off-shore islands to the southwest of it. There are also a few
shell mounds in the Los Angeles&mdash;Ventura area and more numerous
and extensive ones in the San Francisco Bay vicinity. Of the latter
shell mounds A. L. Kroeber writes:</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>&ldquo;... all the classes of objects (shells, refuse, mortars,
pestles, obsidian, charmstones, and bone awls) in question
occur at the bottom, middle, and top of the mounds, and ...
they occur with substantially the same frequency. In other
words, the natives of the San Francisco region traded the same
materials from the same localities one, two, or three thousand
years ago as when they were discovered at the end of the
eighteenth century. They ate the same food, in nearly the
same proportions (only mammalian bones became more abundant
in higher levels), prepared it in substantially the same manner,
and sewed skins, rush mats, and coiled baskets similarly to
their recent descendants. Even their religion was conservative,
since the identical charms seem to have been regarded
potent. In a word, the basis of culture remained identical
during the whole of the shell-mound period.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it is remembered that ... the beginning of this
period (occurred) more than 3,000 years ago, it is clear that
we are here confronted by a historical fact of extraordinary
importance. It means that at the time when Troy was besieged
and Solomon was building the temple, at a period when even
Greek civilization had not yet taken on the traits that we regard
as characteristic, when only a few scattering foundations
of specific modern culture were being laid and our own northern
ancestors dwelled in unmitigated barbarism, the native
Californian already lived in all essentials like his descendant
of today. In Europe and Asia, change succeeded change of the
profoundest type. On this far shore of the Pacific, civilization,
such as it was, remained immutable in all fundamentals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;... The permanence of Californian culture ... is of
far more than local interest. It is a fact of significance in the
history of civilization.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Successive intrusions of different peoples and the isolation of
the resultant developing Indian tribes, century after century, gave
rise to many diverse languages. Although some were mere dialects,
there were about 750 different North American Indian languages.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">Chapter III</span>
<br />THE CALIFORNIA INDIANS</h2>
<p>Dr. A. L. Kroeber&rsquo;s map shows all tribes within the present
political boundaries of the State of California. The tribes of the
extreme northwest corner and those of the southern tip of the state
are not typical of what we generally think of as &ldquo;California
Indians&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Although it may not be scientifically sound to do so, it is often
convenient to refer to the Indian tribes of the California region
collectively. The term &ldquo;Digger Indians&rdquo; is frequently used for
this purpose with a somewhat disparaging connotation. The origin
of this name is traceable to white traders and pioneers who observed
that local Indians dug extensively for a number of food
items, hence the name Digger was applied. However, this is a
poor name as digging was but one of many methods the Indians
used to secure food. Besides, digging was by no means peculiar
to Indians of the California area. It is best, therefore, simply to
use the term California Indians, if one wishes to refer to this group
of tribes as a whole.</p>
<p>In connection with the nickname Digger Indian, it is of interest
to note that the California tribes used the conspicuous pine of the
foothills, <i>Pinus sabiniana</i>, as a source of edible pine nuts and for
other purposes too. Because the so called Digger Indians used
these trees so much, the pioneers named the conifers Digger Pines,
a name recognized today as the proper common name of that tree.</p>
<p>California tribes are usually not considered high culturally
among Indians generally, yet Yurok, Pomo, and Chumash are equal
to any tribe in North America in wood, bone, steatite, obsidian,
feather, and skin work, while local tribes of the Lassen area made
basketry of a variety and quality unsurpassed elsewhere.</p>
<p>Although there were local differences in food habits, the California
Indians as a group had a highly diversified diet in contrast
to the so-called one-food tribes in surrounding areas. Of course
it is an over-simplification to speak of one-food tribes, for all
ate quite a variety of foods. Yet, it is true that several cultures
had been built upon the great abundance and importance of one
particular food item as compared to all other foods eaten. North
of California, Indians built their culture largely upon the salmon.
To the east were tribes which depended upon the bison for most
of their needs, and southeast of California the Southwest Indians
built their culture around the all important maize or native corn.
In any of these regional groups, if the main food item failed, disaster
struck the tribes. In contrast, the Californians, with
diversified eating habits, had four major food sources: fish, game,
roots, and seeds or nuts. Each was important and the failure of
any one caused hardship, but by no means the serious disaster
which befell the more specialized groups of Indians if their main
food supply item failed. If any one item of the California Indian
diet were to be selected as the most important and universal food,
one of the nuts, the acorn would have to be named.</p>

<p>California Indians are often regarded to have been lazy and
shiftless. To be sure there were such individuals, but we have
that type of person in our midst too, and I dare say in equal or
greater percentage. As a matter of fact, Indians generally could
not afford to be lazy&mdash;there was no beneficent government to
coddle them. It was largely a case of sink or swim. They had to
provide their own shelter, food, and clothing as well as what amusement
and extras&mdash;hardly to be called luxuries&mdash;they wished to
enjoy. These things were all wrought from the wilderness with
their own bare hands, using only wood, stone, and fire as tools.
These native Americans lived in a stone-age culture. Metals, the
wheel, domesticated herd animals, and agriculture were unknown
to California Indians. Although there was some seasonal migration,
there were no truly nomadic or wandering tribes in California.</p>
<p>In California there were 103 separate tribes each speaking its
own language. To be sure, some were mere dialects of others, but
there were 21 tongues completely distinct from each other and
mutually unintelligible. These belonged to several unrelated
language families, as shown on the second map.</p>
<p>As suggested above, Kroeber has shown that we are technically
incorrect in referring to the California Indians as a single group
of tribes. Within the political boundaries of the State of California
there were actually three separate cultures with a number of subcultures,
which were as follows: The small area in the northwest
corner of the state, the Klamath River drainage, was occupied by
the Northwest California Sub-culture, a part of the North Pacific
Coast Culture which extended into British Columbia. The California-Great
Basin Culture had three representatives in the state:
the smallest or Lutuami Sub-culture, represented by the Modoc
tribe only, extended down from the north across the east central
portion of the northern boundary of California. The next larger was
the Great Basin Sub-culture just east of the Cascade-Sierra backbone.
The third and largest sub-culture of the California-Great
Basin Culture was that of the Central California tribes (the Diggers
of the pioneer), extending westward from the Cascade-Sierra crest
to the Pacific Ocean across the bulk of the state. The fifth sub-culture
is known as the Southern California comprising the area
south of the Tehachapi Mountains from the coast east across the
Colorado River, being a part of the Southwest Culture.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, some generalities hold, and at the risk of the
inaccuracy which is typical of generalizations, we might set forth
the following customs as being characteristic of California Indians:</p>
<p>Animal flesh bulked a smaller volume of food eaten than did
vegetable materials&mdash;or, in the case of coastal peoples, than did
seafoods. Dog and reptile flesh were considered poisonous or undesirable,
but insects and worms were generally eaten. Acorns
were the most important single food. All tribes utilized seeds of
such plants as buckeye, grass, sedge, and sunflower family plants.
All items, but the first, were collected with a basketry seed beater
in a conical burden basket, parched, winnowed, ground, and eaten
either dry, as unleavened bread, or as boiled mush.</p>
<p>Although the fish hook and line were known throughout the area,
most fishing was done by means of nets, weirs, use of poison, and
harpoons thrust, but not thrown.</p>
<p>Hunting with bow and arrow was most important. Disguise and
dogs were used in the north, but surrounding the game was the
common means of hunting in the south.</p>
<p>The northern bow was short, broad, and sinew backed while
southern Californians used long narrow bows without reinforcement.</p>
<p>Arrows were usually two-piece and tipped with obsidian points.
Three different arrow releases were used among California Indians.
Northern arrows were straightened by use of a hole through a piece
of wood or similar material, and were polished by use of horsetail
stalks while a grooved squarish soapstone (steatite) did both jobs
in the south.</p>
<p>Basketry was highly developed, being California&rsquo;s best art form.
The northern quarter of the area did twined basketry; coiled basketry
prevailed elsewhere.</p>
<p>Cloth was unknown, but woven rabbit skin strip blankets were
universal, especially for bedding. Rush mats were twined and
sewn.</p>
<p>Pottery was unknown except for a very crude undecorated form
in the San Joaquin Valley, an intrusion from the Southern California
Sub-culture where pottery became important.</p>
<p>Music of California was characterized by singing, rattles,
whistles, split slap sticks, flute, and musical bow. The last two
instruments were the only ones which were able to make real melodies,
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
but amazingly, neither one was used for dances or ceremonies.
California Indians were virtually without any drums&mdash;the exception
being a single headed flat foot drum used in ceremonial sweathouse
chambers of the tribes in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys.</p>
<p>Dress of California women was a front and a back apron of skin&mdash;especially
buckskin&mdash;or of plant fiber. Men wore nothing or a
folded skin about the hips or between the legs. In bad weather both
sexes used cape-like or wrap-around (over one arm and under the
other) skin robes. In localized areas the brimless dome-shaped
basketry cap was worn by women. Hair of both sexes was long (but
shorn in mourning) and frequently put up in nets by men. Men removed
their beards by pulling with their fingers.</p>
<p>In mountain areas social and religious cults were lacking. In
the extreme northwest corner wealth dances were held; in central
California the secret society and Kuksu dances, in the south the
Jimsonweed initiation system, and in the Colorado River area the
dreamsong ceremony flourished.</p>
<p>Houses varied from open enclosures and brush or bark shelters
to frame structures more or less completely dug into the ground and
covered with bark, brush, and dirt, usually with a roof entrance and
or one to the south; this was the earth lodge. In the extreme northwest
housing was not the earth lodge, but a structure built on top
of the ground; hand-split planks were used in its construction.</p>
<p>Sweat houses were of the earth lodge type, often of daily service
and in northern areas, lived in too. Sweat houses of California were
not heated by steam, but directly with fire.</p>
<p>Boats generally were of rushes tied into balsa rafts or into boat
shapes. In addition one-piece dugout canoes from tree logs were
typical of the northern portion of California, becoming progressively
more refined in workmanship and in design to the northwest. A
unique lashed split board canoe was made by channel island tribes
in the Santa Barbara vicinity.</p>
<p>The tribe as a political unit, so common elsewhere in America,
did not exist in California. What we call a tribe was actually a
number of groups of Indians, each of whom had a chief, spoke the
same language dialect, had the same customs, intermarried regularly,
and were usually mutually friendly. There was no tribal
chief as such.</p>
<p>In the northwest portion of California wealth was so important
that real chieftain leadership was lacking. In central and southern
California the chief was a powerful local leader on a hereditary
basis. Between the two extremes was a zone where tribes struck a
compromise; the hereditary local chief had moderate authority and
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
usually was well to do, but not necessarily so. Rich men in smaller
political divisions were influential headmen under the local chief.</p>
<p>Warfare was only for revenge and not for plunder or for a desire
for distinction. Except for the Northwest Sub-culture, scalps were
generally taken and included the victim&rsquo;s skin down to his eyes
or nose, and including the ears. Not infrequently the whole head
was taken by a victorious warrior. The weapon was the bow and
arrow, with rocks employed in close combat. Such war implements
as shields, clubs, spears (throwing), and tomahawks were not used.</p>
<p>Guessing games, usually played by men, were universal, with
variations, and heavy gambling was the rule. Shinny in several
different forms was widely played.</p>
<p>Shamans were employed for curing diseases which were believed
due to the presence in the body of some foreign hostile object. This
was removed by sucking accompanied by singing, dancing, and
tobacco smoking.</p>
<p>The girls&rsquo; adulthood or puberty ceremony and dance was important
to all California tribes.</p>
<p>Population figures even on the most scholarly basis, Kroeber
states, are at best reasonable guesses. As nearly as can be determined
there were originally about one million Indians in North
America, three million in Central America, and three million in
South America. California probably had about 133,000 Indians or
nearly one per square mile. This is a density three or four times
greater than for the whole of North America.</p>
<p>Today the North American Indian population (including about
30% half-breeds) is less than 10% of what it was. Over 90% of our
Indians have been destroyed by wholesale killing at the hands
of the white man, by new diseases, unfavorable changes in diet,
clothing, and dwellings plus such Caucasian cultural factors as
settlement, concentration, and the like. The decline in Indian
population varied directly with the degree of civilized contact the
several tribes experienced. It is interesting to note that virtually
all of the Indians exposed to the Spanish missions commencing
1769 are gone except for a few in the extreme south who were only
partly missionized. Kroeber states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It must have caused many of the fathers a severe pang to
realize, as they could not but do daily, that they were saving
souls only at the inevitable cost of lives. And yet such was
the overwhelming fact. The brute upshot of missionization,
in spite of its kindly flavor and humanitarian root, was only
one thing: death.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Kroeber also points out that some tribes had much less resistance
and hence suffered greater decline in population in response
to equal white contact than others did. As in the case of other
living things, there were favorable circumstances under which the
Indian flourished&mdash;where life was relatively easy and secure.
Such conditions produced virile stock and a rich culture both materially
and spiritually&mdash;a condition found in broad valleys drained
by the great rivers of California: the Klamath, the Sacramento, and
the San Joaquin. As is also the case with specific plants and
animals, Indians in less favorable sites lived submarginally&mdash;a
difficult existence, poor in material and spiritual culture. Under
such circumstances it takes just a small amount of additional unfavorable
influence to make existence impossible. On this basis
Kroeber explains the extinction or near extinction of poor mountain
tribes upon contact with the whites while the Indians of the fertile
valleys, although suffering more intensive Caucasian contact, were
able to survive in reasonable numbers. This is a specific exception
to the general observation made above that population decrease
varied directly with the degree of contact. There are examples in
California; the local one is the survival of valley Maidu and Wintun
populations as compared to the surrounding mountain people with
poorer cultures: the Yahi, Yana, Okwanuchu, Shasta, New River
Shasta, Chimariko, and the Athabascan tribes of the west with
survival percentages today of up to only 5% at best.</p>
<p>There is another factor which caused greater devastation of the
economically insecure mountain tribes. White settlers were able
to use to their own advantage some of the labor, services, and even
food which the valley Indians afforded them. Thus it was not to the
interest of the whites to wipe out these Indians. On the other hand,
the mountain tribes with a poorer economy were prone to steal livestock
to supplement their food supplies as they had no means to
gain wealth to enable them to buy from the whites. Such depredations
were a major cause of retaliation by white man in the form of
bloody punitive attacks on Indians from whom the settlers had
nothing to gain.</p>

<br />INDIAN TRIBES OF THE LASSEN AREA</h2>
<p>Lassen Peak with an elevation of 10,453 feet above sea level
is the central high point of a somewhat topographically isolated
mountain mass of volcanic origin. The slopes descending in all
directions from Lassen Peak are clothed in coniferous forests,
dotted with small lakes of glacial origin, and drained by a few fish
bearing streams flowing radially from the mountain. There are also
a few hot spring areas and some barren expanses where recent
eruptions have produced mudflows and lavas. For the most part,
game abounds in the Lassen highland, but the winters are snowy
and severe, making it unsuitable for Indians to live there the year
around.</p>
<p>As shown on the map, parts of the lands of four distinct tribes
of Indians lay within what are today the boundaries of Lassen
Volcanic National Park. Permanent homes and villages of Atsugewi,
Yana, Yahi and mountain Maidu tribes were at lower elevations in
the Ponderosa Pine and Digger Pine belts, and situated near
streams. There food was relatively easily available and winters
were the least severe within the limits of the respective tribal
territories.</p>
<p>Each summer when deer migrated to higher elevations, the
Indians also moved toward Lassen Peak to hunt and to fish trout,
spending the whole summer in temporary camps.</p>
<p>There was some contact between the four tribes during their
sojourns in the uplands of the park area, but the activities of each
Indian group were pretty well confined to its own territory. The
four Lassen tribes did on occasion engage in small battles, but
this was the exception rather than the rule&mdash;generally speaking
they lived harmoniously as neighbors, and there was even
occasional inter-marriage between tribes.</p>
<p>These tribes all had simple hill or mountain cultures which,
in spite of some difference of custom, were surprisingly alike. It
is believed that this is due to the fact that the four tribes all lived
under very similar conditions of environment&mdash;the same type of
country in many respects. The similarity of their cultures is all the
more interesting in that the Atsugewi were of the Hokan Family,
speaking a Shastan language. Yana and Yahi, also of Hokan stock
spoke Yana languages. The mountain Maidu were of the Penutian
Family, speaking a Maidu language.</p>
<p>According to the best available figures, some of which are only
reasonable guesses, populations of the local tribes were probably
about as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Garth states that: &ldquo;The Atsugewi are divided into two
major groups, the Atsuge or pinetree-people, who occupy Hat
Creek Valley, and the Apwaruge&mdash;from Apwariwa, the name of
Dixie Valley&mdash;who live to the east in and around Dixie Valley.
Sometimes the Apwaruge are called Mahoupani, juniper-tree-people,
a name which reflects the dry and barren nature of
their territory....</p>
<p>&ldquo;... certain cultural differences (existed) between
the eastern and western Atsugewi, who in most aspects of
nonmaterial culture and in language are one people. In the
western area there was more abundant rainfall and a fairly
luxuriant growth of pines, oaks, and other trees. Here the
Atsuge subsisted largely on acorns and fish; made twined
basketry, using willow, pine root, <i>Xerophylum</i> grass, and redbud
materials; and had bark houses and numerous other
structures of bark. On the contrary, in the eastern area, which
is comparatively arid and lacking in trees, the Apwaruge depended
on the acorn less than did the Atsuge and fishing was
less important, to judge by the scarcity or lack of nets, fish
hooks, and harpoons; made inferior twined baskets of twisted
tule with a different twist to the weave; as a rule had their
houses covered with tule mats rather than with bark; and were
much poorer than the Atsuge. This cultural distinction between
the eastern and western areas is also found to the north among
the Achomawi.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dixon&rsquo;s studies have revealed that the Maidu had no general
name for themselves, remarkable as this may seem. The name
Maidu was first used by Stephen Powers in 1877 in his volume
&ldquo;TRIBES OF CALIFORNIA&rdquo;, a name he arbitrarily applied to these
Indians since the word meant &ldquo;Indian&rdquo; or &ldquo;man&rdquo; in their language.
The adjectives northwest or valley, northeast or mountain, and
southern or foothill are applied to identify the three different cultures
corresponding to the three distinct geographic provinces
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
inhabited by the Maidu Indians as a whole. In a number of respects
the culture of the mountain or northeast Maidu was more like that
of their northern neighbors, the Atsugewi, than it was like that of
the closely related southern and northwestern Maidu peoples.
Obviously the factor of environment or characteristics of the land
occupied is of extreme importance in creating such a situation.</p>

<br />INDIAN&mdash;PIONEER CONFLICT AND THE STORY OF ISHI</h2>
<p>Conflict&mdash;prolonged, tragic, and violent&mdash;flared during the
period when Europeans wrested control of North America from the
native Indian. In viewing the struggle between Indian and white
man, feelings run high even today.</p>
<p>What was it when Custer&rsquo;s contingent was wiped out?&mdash;when
the Modocs inflicted such heavy losses on the American troops?&mdash;when
the Navajo, Sioux, and others made their devastating raids
on wagon trains and pioneer settlers? These were just as much a
part of the war as were the exploits of Rogers&rsquo; Rangers, the indiscriminate
slaying of Indian men, women, and children in the Yahi
caves on Mill Creek, and the annihilation of large segments of
Atsugewi and Yana tribes cornered at points northwest of the
present Lassen Volcanic National Park area. War is never a pretty
thing. Was the hit and run killing of white people by Indians any
less defensible morally than white man&rsquo;s atrocities against the
Indians, or, for that matter, than commando raids and atomic bombings
of today? Our viewpoint on such matters in the past has all
too often been that might makes right, since we have always been
on the winning side. Until very recently we have followed the
biased opinion of the colonists and pioneers of these United States:
whenever we won, it was a glorious and righteous victory, but if
the Indian emerged victorious, it was regarded as a dastardly
massacre. It is a viewpoint readily understandable where a person&rsquo;s
loved ones are involved&mdash;but not justifiable.</p>
<p>Our veterans of recent wars will vouch for the fact that white
man&rsquo;s wars can be primitive and violent when life and limb are at
stake. We are hardly in a position to criticize the &ldquo;cruel and
sneaking&rdquo; fighting methods of the Indians. Was it not use of Indian
fighting methods which was so valuable to us in defeating the
British in the colonial war for independence?</p>
<p>Indians fought in the only way they knew&mdash;and a disheartening
losing fight it was for them with bows and arrows against rifles.
For each gain in weapons and technical know-how the Indians
made, the whites made many. True, it cost Americans much in the
way of lives, anguish, and money, but how small were these losses
in comparison to those of the Indians. American Indians, the undisputed
owners of this continent for thousands of years, were not
only nearly exterminated, but in the end we took virtually all of
their land by force and with it took away the means of self support
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
as well without &ldquo;due process of law&rdquo;. We denied the Indian the
right of &ldquo;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&rdquo;&mdash;the very
things for which we as a nation stand. In all fairness, however, it
should be stated that in recent years modest monetary retribution
has been made by the U.S. Government to some of the surviving
descendants.</p>
<p>S. F. Cook has pointed out that Spanish contact with California
Indians was a rather passive matter. Spanish penetrated deeply,
but did not settle on Indian lands of appreciable size. The Spanish
were present in small numbers, a population numbering perhaps
4,000 by 1848. To be sure there was occasional bloodshed, but
it was the exception in Spanish California rather than the rule, for
the Spanish regarded Indians as an asset, a human resource which
provided labor and even some food and materials. The Indians
were a respected element in the social and economic structure of
Hispanic California, having civic and legal rights. Even under
the Spanish, was there a great reduction of the Indian population
through limited warfare and displacement, but much more importantly
through disease. Nevertheless, by 1845 a more or less satisfactory
equilibrium seems to have evolved between the Spanish and the
California Indians.</p>
<p>In contrast the hordes of white immigrants who followed considered
the Indians entirely useless and there was no place for the
latter in the pioneers&rsquo; economy of material wealth. All good lands
were taken from the Indians arbitrarily and as quickly as possible.
However, it must be stated that there were exceptions to both the
Spanish and Gringo relations with the California Indians, but, in
general, the foregoing statements are accurate.</p>
<p>How the conflict of pioneer versus Indian affected the Atsugewi
is summarized for us by Garth as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Atsugewi, because of their somewhat secluded mountain
habitat, were spared contact with white civilization until
the middle of the nineteenth century. Although there were
vague reports of contact with Spanish explorers or Mexican
bandits, these could not be verified. Peter Skene Ogden may
have been the first white man to visit the area (1827-1828).
Besides the trappers, Fremont, Greenwood, and other explorers
probably skirted Atsugewi country. Peter Lassen passed
through Achomawi-Atsugewi country in opening the Pit River
Route of 1848. He was soon followed by a stream of white
migration from the east which was devastating to the Indians
and their culture. Prospectors entered the Lassen region in
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
1851, and not long afterward came white settlers. By about
1859 the Indians were felt to be a menace to the whites in the
area and were rounded up by militia and taken to the Round
Valley Indian Reservation. Unsatisfactory conditions at the
Reservation caused most of them to leave in 1863 and return
to their old haunts along Hat Creek and Dixie Valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joaquin Miller reports an uprising in 1867 of the Pit River
and Modoc Indians, who had made up old differences and were
now fighting together. A number of whites were massacred.
Miller speaks of an Indian camp being made on Hat Creek in
the war that followed. It is not thus improbable that the
Atsuge participated in that war. After a year or so of fighting
the Indians suffered a final crushing defeat and surrendered.
This last engagement may be the one at Six Mile Hill, spoken
of by informants, in which a large number of their people were
cornered in a cave and massacred by soldiers. After this,
many of the Indians were again removed to Round Valley.
Those remaining and some who subsequently returned from the
Reservation maintained friendly relations with the whites.
Today most Atsugewi live on allotments in their old territory,
the younger Indians often working for their white neighbors or
for the lumber mills. The census of 1910 gives a population
of 240 for &lsquo;Hat Creek Indians&rsquo;. This figure may also have
included the Dixie Valley Atsugewi, since they are not mentioned
in the census. The present population is probably half
that or less.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Maidu also were decimated upon contact with white man.
However, with only rare exception, Maidu accepted rather passively
invasion of their territory with the attendant driving away of game
and destruction of fish in the streams by mining operations in gold
rush days. However, since the remnants of the Maidu were in the
way of white mans&rsquo; developments, treaties were made in 1851 by
which these Indians gave up all claims to their ancestral lands and
were taken to short lived reservations in Amador, Nevada and
Butte Counties, also later to the Round Valley Reservations in the
Coast Range. A great many Maidu soon returned to their homes.
In the late 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s a desultory war was waged on the Maidu
by California State troops which further reduced the number of surviving
Indians of this tribe.</p>
<p>The management of the University of California&rsquo;s excellent
informative &ldquo;UNIVERSITY EXPLORER&rdquo; radio program series has
given permission to quote the following from its broadcasts. This
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
material concerns the conflict of the closely related Yana and Yahi
tribes with the whites and the fabulous story of Ishi. The script
has been abridged and considerably rearranged:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;... The Yana way of life was a strange one to the white
observer, but the tribes prospered under it until white emigration
from the East threw them into conflict with a new and
unfriendly people. The Indians, of course, resented the white
incursion and revolted against it. That happened in all sections
of the country where whites displaced Indians, but it
would be hard to imagine a more inept way of handling the
situation than that used by the white men in the Sacramento
Valley. Some of the large land owners protected the Indians
of their holdings; among them were General John Bidwell,
one of the founders of Chico, (Peter Lassen on his Rancho
Bosquejo between Mill and Deer Creeks), and John Sutter,
on whose property the Gold Rush started. But they were exceptions.
Most of the settlers apparently believed the only way
to handle the natives was to compete with them in cruelty.
One celebrated Indian-killer took great pride in a blanket he
had made from Indian scalps. The whites had learned scalping
from the Eastern Indians, but they themselves popularized
it in California....</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indians often plundered settlers&rsquo; cabins and stole
livestock. This was natural, since they regarded the whites
as invaders. Unfortunately, the settlers&rsquo; retaliation frequently
consisted of rounding up a gang of Indians and slaughtering
them. And it didn&rsquo;t make too much difference whether they
were the guilty Indians. Professor Waterman wrote that the
Yahi expressed their resentment of the white men more
violently than did the other Yana groups, but since the Yahi
moved around more and displayed greater skill in hiding out,
quite innocent groups of Indians often took the blame for the
acts of the Yahi. Professor Waterman cited the case of one
white posse which took to the trail following a series of
Indian raids. The posse came upon an encampment of Indians
and shot about forty of them. But the Indians had been camped
in the same place for two nights, and the whites later found
a couple of almost-empty whiskey barrels there. It doesn&rsquo;t
stand to reason, Professor Waterman pointed out, that Indians
skilled in warfare would be so careless after an attack on
their enemies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the animosity between white men and red men grew,
the atrocities on both sides became revolting. White women
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
and children were tortured and killed by the Yana. But the
anthropologists who have studied this unpleasant phase of
California history believe the whites invited such savage
assaults by their own brutal mistreatment of the Indians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;... The Yana gradually took to the woods as it became
obvious that they were being outnumbered and decimated by
the settlers in one massacre after another. By the late 1860&rsquo;s
the Indians had been reduced in numbers and intimidated to
the point where they no longer could be considered a serious
menace to the people who had taken over their hunting
grounds. By then the Indians&rsquo; crimes were more on the level
of petty theft than major violence. The three Yana tribes had
become almost extinct as social organizations, but a fair
number of Yana-speaking individuals survived long after the
turn of the century.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the Yahi tribe, however, it was a different story. For
a long time the Yahi&mdash;then called the Mill Creeks, because
area around that little stream was their principal hunting
ground&mdash;for a long time, the Yahi were believed to have been
wiped out in a final massacre in 1865.... In 1871, a group
of cattle-herders in Tehama County found a spot where
Indians apparently had wounded a steer. The whites used
dogs to follow the steer&rsquo;s bloody trail, and cornered some
thirty Indians in a hillside cave. They promptly slaughtered
the Indians, including several children. The settlers&rsquo; peculiar
idea of mercy was pointed out by Professor Waterman&rsquo;s informant,
who noted that one of the cattle-herders could not
bear to kill the children with his .56 caliber rifle&mdash;&lsquo;it tore
them up so bad&rsquo; he said. So he did it instead with a .38 caliber
revolver.... They call the rock shelter Kingsley Cave
after Norman Kingsley, the settler who ... supposedly ...
shot the Indian children. The Kingsley Cave site was apparently
used for a long time. Grinding tools of two different
cultural periods were found ... (by University of California
Archeological Survey staff excavations currently investigating
the site).</p>
<p>(The Yahi were thought to have been completely wiped out
by this last unjustified atrocity, but in 1908) &ldquo;... surveyors
for a power company in the hilly country around Deer Creek
reported they had caught a glimpse of a naked Indian standing
poised near the stream with a double-pronged primitive fishing
spear. Next day, other members of the party were startled
when an arrow came whistling through the underbrush at them&mdash;a
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
stone-tipped arrow like those used by the supposedly
extinct Indians. The surveyors kept on pushing ahead, until
they came upon a cleverly concealed camp in the tangled
woods. There they found a middle-aged woman and two aged
and feeble Indians, a man and a woman. The old woman,
hiding under a pile of rabbit skins, apparently wanted water,
and the surveyors gave her some after the old man and the
other woman had hidden in the underbrush. The surveyors
also carried off all the blankets, bows and arrows and other
articles in sight; but when they returned next day to make
some sort of restitution, the Indians had disappeared. They
were never seen again, even though the University later sent
anthropologists in search of them....</p>
<p>&ldquo;... with the dawn of a clear August day in 1911....
The butchering crew of a slaughterhouse near Oroville were
awakened ... by a furious barking of the dogs at the corral.
They rushed into the corral to find a man crouching in the
mud, surrounded by the slaughterhouse shepherd dogs. The
butchers called off the dogs to get a closer look at their guest&mdash;and
a most unusual guest he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man&rsquo;s only clothing was a piece of torn, dirty canvas
across his shoulders. His skin was sunburned to a copper
brown, his hair was clipped close to the skull, and he obviously
was suffering from severe malnutrition. His body
was emaciated and his cheeks clung to the bones to accentuate
his furiously glaring eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the strangest thing about this man was his speech.
It was like nothing the butchers had ever heard.... The
sheriff tried English and Spanish, then several Indian dialects.
But he was unable to draw any intelligible response from his
prisoner. For lack of a better place to put him, the sheriff
locked him in the jail cell reserved for mental cases, even
though the man from the slaughterhouse appeared to be more
lost than insane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Wild Man of Oroville&rsquo; made good newspaper copy,
and clippings about his mysterious discovery caused much
excitement in the department of anthropology at the University
of California. It was a good thing that the news reached the
University when it did. The frightened wild man was cowering
in his cell, refusing to accept food from his captors whom he
obviously distrusted, while the sheriff vainly tried to identify
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The late Professor T. T. Waterman was especially excited.
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
So excited, in fact, that he stuffed a few clothes in
his suitcase, quickly picked out a list of words from the files
on California Indian languages, and caught the first train to
Oroville for an interview with the prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reason for Professor Waterman&rsquo;s excitement was that
he believed the Oroville prisoner was a Yahi Indian. If this
guess was correct, Waterman would have a major anthropological
find. For anthropologists are concerned with origins,
development and variegated cultures of mankind; and if the
frightened prisoner in Oroville turned out to be a Yahi, Professor
Waterman and his colleagues would have a living
encyclopedia of the language, customs, and habits of a people
who were believed to be extinct ... he might be one of the
little band reported at Deer Creek (in 1908), perhaps the man
with the fishing spear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The task of determining whether the prisoner was Yahi was
complicated by the fact that no one knew the Yahi language.
This doesn&rsquo;t sound like an insuperable stumbling block, until
you remember that the California Indian languages were
numerous and distinct; there were over one hundred dialects,
many of them mutually unintelligible. These dialects were
classified into eighteen major language groups, which in turn
made up six entirely different language families. These six
language families apparently are completely unrelated&mdash;a
strange circumstance, when you consider that almost all of
the languages of Europe can be traced to common origins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, Professor Waterman was fortunate in one respect.
A fairly extensive word-list had been collected from
the dialect of the Nozi Indians who had once lived just to the
north of the Yahi and were their nearest relatives. Both the
Yahi and the Nozi belonged to the Yana language stock, which
stemmed from the widespread Hokan family. So Professor
Waterman relied on Nozi words to make the identification.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first, the prisoner in Oroville seemed as frightened
of Professor Waterman as he had been of all the other white
men. Patiently, the anthropologist proceeded through his list
of Nozi words, but the captive Indian apparently recognized
none of them. At last, though, the professor pointed to the
wooden frame of the Indian&rsquo;s cot, and pronounced the word
&lsquo;si&rsquo;wi&rsquo;ni,&rsquo; which according to his list meant &lsquo;yellow pine&rsquo;.
Immediately, the Indian relaxed. His harried, unhappy look
turned to beaming good cheer, and he acted as if he had found
a long-lost friend. Pointing to his cot, he repeated Professor
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
Waterman&rsquo;s word &lsquo;si&rsquo;wi&rsquo;ni&rsquo; several times, as if agreeing
that, yes, his cot was yellow pine. His own language differed
from that of the Nozi, but some of the vocabulary was the
same. Professor Waterman had struck upon one of the right
words; later, he pronounced more familiar words, and it was
established that the Indian was a Yahi. He also managed to
explain that he called himself &lsquo;Ishi&rsquo;, which meant simply,
&lsquo;I am a man&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professor Waterman was naturally elated with his new-found
acquaintance. The Butte County sheriff was equally
elated to be rid of his difficult charge, so Ishi was taken to
the Museum, then located in San Francisco, for further study
and interrogation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus it happened that this human relic of the Stone Age
came to live at a modern university. The Regents of the
University gave Ishi some official status by appointing him an
assistant janitor at $25 a month. But his value to the University
did not come from dexterity with a mop and broom;
he was valued because he could tell the anthropologists about
his people, preserving knowledge which otherwise would have
died with his fellow-tribesmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ishi adapted himself well to this new life, and he was a
friendly and popular fixture at the museum for five years. He
picked up the white man&rsquo;s ways by watching the people around
him; at his first civilized dinner, he imitated his hosts&rsquo;
motions and managed a knife and fork far more skilfully than
most of us can handle chopsticks in a Chinese restaurant.
He was delighted and awe-stricken by many of the developments
of civilization; but the things that impressed him most
were not what the anthropologists had expected. Electric
lights, airplanes, and automobiles made little impression;
they were completely beyond his range of experience, and he
dismissed them as &lsquo;white man&rsquo;s magic&rsquo;, worthy of little attention.
The tall buildings in downtown San Francisco did not
startle him; as he explained, his own country had cliffs and
crags just as high. But what really amazed him about the city
were the enormous crowds of people on the streets. He had
seen people before, of course, but never more than twenty or
thirty in one place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In general, the things that Ishi considered most remarkable
were things which approached something in his own
experience. He knew how hard it was to start a fire by friction,
so pocket matches were indeed a wonder. Water faucets
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
which could be turned on and off were likewise marvelous;
why, the white man could make a spring, right there in the
house! One of the first modern devices to catch Ishi&rsquo;s babbled
attention was an ordinary window roller shade. He tried to
push it aside, but it flipped back; he lifted it, but it fell down.
Finally someone showed him how to give it a little tug and
let it roll itself up, and Ishi was amazed. A half-hour later,
he was still trying to figure out what had happened to the
shade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ishi and his hosts learned to communicate with each other
fairly adequately; he never became accustomed to formal
grammar, but he picked up a vocabulary large enough to express
his wishes and his comments about the things around
him. Actually, the anthropologists admitted, Ishi learned to
speak English far better than any of them were able to learn
Yahi. They suspected that some of his vocabulary was
acquired from the school children who used to visit him, for
it included a fair sampling of most unacademic slang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were some things Ishi didn&rsquo;t like to talk about&mdash;the
death of his relatives and the last horrible years around
Deer Creek before he wandered to the Oroville slaughterhouse&mdash;were
subjects he found too painful. Besides, there was
a tribal taboo against mentioning the names of the dead. His
close-cropped head, incidentally, was the result of burning
off his hair in mourning for his mother and sister, in accordance
with tribal custom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the knowledge which Ishi passed on was rich and
varied.... Among the contributions for which Ishi is remembered
are some of the finest arrowheads and spear tips in
existence; he made these for the University Museum both of
modern bottle glass and from the natural materials.... In
fact, Ishi was the source of almost all that is known of Yahi
life. He gladly described the customs of his people, and he
enjoyed chipping out Stone Age weapons and showing how
they were used. With primitive drawings, he tried to tell the
story of the massacre which wiped out most of his tribe....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ishi&rsquo;s own life ended in March 1916, when he died of
tuberculosis. He was then believed to be in his 50&rsquo;s. Those
who knew him at the University considered his death a great
loss&mdash;not only because of what he had contributed to
anthropology, but because he had a natural friendliness and
dignity which made him a beloved personality. Professor
A. L. Kroeber once told me: &lsquo;The manner in which he acquitted
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
himself, both from the scientific and social points of view,
was so admirable that everyone who chanced to meet him
counted it a privilege to be his friend&rsquo;. And Ishi had the
comforting knowledge that his departure from this earth would
not be a completely alien one. Because he had passed on
the elements of his culture, it was possible to bury him with
all the ceremony of his own people. His bows and arrows
were laid beside him, and some bowls of food were placed in
the grave so he would not grow hungry on his long journey
to the Happy Hunting Ground....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ishi was not only the last survivor of the Yahi ... but
he was also believed to (have been) the last representative
of the Stone Age in the United States.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While not apropos to the subject of this chapter, &ldquo;Pioneer Conflict...&rdquo;
we digress with some quotations from Pope&rsquo;s &ldquo;Medical
History of Ishi&rdquo; to give the reader a better understanding of this
last of the Mill Creek Indians, his character, and his beliefs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;... Ishi himself later made the statement that he was
not sick but had no food. White men had taken his bow and
arrows; game was scarce, and he had no means of procuring
it. He had strayed from his usual trail, between Deer Creek
and ... Lassen (Peak). The railroad on one side and a
large river on the other kept him from making his way to the
refuge of the hills. His fear of trains and automobiles seems
to have been considerable in those days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon being captured, Ishi, according to his own account,
was handcuffed, confronted by guns and pistols, and intimidated
to such an extent that he vomited with fear....</p>
<p>&ldquo;About this time (fall, 1912) I became instructor in surgery
in the University Medical School, and thus came in contact
with the Indian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the first weeks of our intimacy a strong friendship
grew up between us, and I was from that time on his physician,
his confidant, and his companion in archery....</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Museum (of Anthropology) is near the Hospital, and
since Ishi had been made a more or less privileged character
in the hospital wards, he often came into the surgical department.
Here he quietly helped the nurses clean instruments,
or amused the internes and nurses by singing his Indian
songs, or carried on primitive conversation by means of a very
complex mixture of gesture, Yana dialect, and the few scraps
of English he had acquired in his contact with us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His affability and pleasant disposition made him a universal
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
favorite. He visited the sick in the wards with a gentle
and sympathetic look which spoke more clearly than words.
He came to the women&rsquo;s wards quite regularly, and with his
hands folded before him, he would go from bed to bed like a
visiting physician, looking at each patient with quiet concern
or with a fleeting smile that was very kindly received and
understood.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>&ldquo;ISHI&rsquo;S MEDICAL BELIEFS&rdquo;</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Women&mdash;Ishi had many of our own obsolete superstitions
regarding women. One criticism he made of white man&rsquo;s civilization
was the unbridled liberty we give menstruating
women. The &lsquo;Sako mahale&rsquo;, as he designated them, were a
cause of much ill luck and sickness. They should be in
seclusion during this period. In fact, he often commented on
the number of sick men that came to the hospital. I asked
him what he thought made so many men sick. He said it was
&lsquo;Sako mahale, too much wowi (houses), too much automobile,&rsquo;
and last but most important of all, the &lsquo;Coyote doctor&rsquo;, or
evil spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dogs&mdash;Playing with dogs, and letting them lick one&rsquo;s
hand, Ishi said was very bad. He assured me that to let babies
play with dogs this way led to paralysis. It is interesting to
note that Dr. R. H. Gibson of Fort Gibson, Alaska, has reported
the coincidence of poliomyelitis among the Tanana
Indians and the occurrence of distempers in dogs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rattlesnakes&mdash;Ishi&rsquo;s treatment for rattlesnake bite was
to bind a toad or frog on the affected area. This is interesting
in the light of the experiments of Madame Phisalix of the
Pasteur Institute, who demonstrated the antidotal properties
of salamandrin, an extract obtained from salamander skin,
and the natural immunity that the salamander has to viper
venom. Macht and Abel have obtained a similar powerful
alkaloid from the toad <i>Bufo nigra</i>, called bufagin, which has
some of the properties of strychnin and adrenalin. It has been
used as an arrow poison by South American aborigines. Experiments
which I conducted with salamandrin as an antidote
to crotalin, show that it has a pronounced protective and
curative value in the immunization of guinea pigs and in their
cure after being bitten by the rattlesnake. It is, however, too
dangerous and potent a poison itself to be of any practical
value.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When out camping we killed and cooked a rattlesnake or
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
&lsquo;kemna&rsquo;. Ishi refused not only to taste it, but also to eat
from the dishes in which it had been cooked. We ate it, and
found that it tasted like rabbit or fish. Ishi expected us to
die. That we did not do so he could only explain on the
grounds that I was a medicine man and used magic protection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moon&mdash;Ishi held the superstition common among uneducated
Caucasians, that it is unwholesome to sleep with the
moon shining on one&rsquo;s face, so he covered his head completely
under his blankets when sleeping in the open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hygiene&mdash;Ishi had wholesome notions of hygiene. When
out hunting he has several times stopped me from drinking
water from a stream which he thought had been contaminated
by dwelling houses above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His residence in the Museum caused many misgivings in
his mind. The presence of all the bones of the dead, their
belongings, and the mummies were ever a source of anxiety
to him. He locked his bedroom door at night to keep out
spirits. When we stored our camping provender temporarily in
the Museum bone room, Ishi was not only disgusted but genuinely
alarmed. It was only after the reassurance that the
&lsquo;bunch a mi si tee&rsquo; could not enter through the tin of the cans
that he was relieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surgery&mdash;On some of his visits to the University Hospital,
Ishi gazed through the glass-panelled door of the
operating room and watched the less grewsome scenes therein,
wondering no doubt what was the meaning of this work ...
and his questions afterward, though few and imperfectly
understood, showed that he marveled most at the anaesthetic
and that he debated the advisability of such surgical work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once he saw me remove a diseased kidney. He viewed
the sleeping man with deep wonder. He seemed interested at
the methods we employed to prevent hemorrhage. For days
afterwards he asked me if the patient still lived, and seemed
incredulous when I said he did. When he saw an operation for
the removal of tonsils he asked me why it was done. I told
him of the pain and soreness which was indicative of disease,
and necessitated the operation. He conveyed to me the information
that among his people tonsillitis was cured by
rubbing honey on the neck, and blowing ashes down the throat
through a hollow stick or quill; no operations were necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only surgical operation with which he seemed familiar
was scarification. This was accomplished by means of small
flakes of obsidian and had as its purpose the strengthening
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
of the arms and legs of men about to go out on a hunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herbs&mdash;His own knowledge of the use of medicinal
herbs was considerable, as we learned later when he went
back to Deer Creek canyon with us on a three weeks&rsquo; camping
trip, here he designated scores of plants that were of technical,
medicinal, or economic value. But he put very little
faith in these things. The use of herbs and drugs seems to
have been the province of old women in the tribe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a hole in the septum of his nose which he had
used as a receptacle for a small piece of wood, as well as for
holding ornaments. When he had a cold he placed in this
spot a twig of baywood or juniper, and indicated to me that
this was medicine. It served very much with him as menthol
inhalers do with us. Its influence was largely psychic but
agreeable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magic&mdash;The real medicine was magic. The mysteries of
the k&rsquo;uwi, or medicine man, were of much greater value than
mere dosing. Their favorite charms seem to have been either
blowing of smoke and ashes in certain directions to wield a
protective or curative influence, or the passing of coals of
fire through themselves or their patients by means of sleight
of hand. They also sucked out small bits of obsidian or cactus
thorns from their clients, averring that these were the etiological
factors of sickness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The principal cause of pain, according to Ishi, was the
entrance of these spines, thorns, bee stings, or, as he called
them, &lsquo;pins&rsquo;, into the human frame. The medicine man sucked
them out, or plucked them while they were floating in the air
in the vicinity of the sick man. They were then deposited in
a small container, usually made of the dried trachea of a bird,
or of a large artery. The ends of this tube were sealed with
pitch or some form of a stopper and the whole thing taken
possession of by the doctor, thus keeping the &lsquo;materia
morbosa&rsquo; where it could do no further harm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact that I was able to do sleight of hand: vanish
coins, change eggs into paper, swallow impossible objects at
will, and perform similar parlor magic, convinced Ishi that
I was a real doctor, much more than any medication or surgery
at my command. He came, nevertheless, to our clinic whenever
he had a headache, or a bruised member, or lumbago, and
accepted our services with due faith.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<h3>&ldquo;ISHI&rsquo;S PERSONAL HABITS&rdquo;</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Sleep&mdash;... he slept between blankets in preference
to sheets. He had several flannelette nightshirts but he preferred
to sleep naked....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clothing&mdash;... At first he was offered moccasins, but
refused to wear them. He wanted to be like other people.
Usually he wore a bright colored necktie and sometimes a hat,
when he was going down town ... cotton shirts and (cotton)
trousers were his choice. He used a pocket handkerchief in
the most approved manner, and because of his frequent colds
he needed it often.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Modesty&mdash;Ishi, strange to say, was very modest. Although
he went practically naked in the wilds, and, as
described by Waterman, upon his first appearance in Deer
Creek Canyon he was seen altogether nude, nevertheless,
his first request after being captured was for a pair of overalls.
He was quite careful to cover his genitalia; when
changing clothes, assumed protective attitudes, and when
swimming in the mountain streams with us wore an improvised
breech clout even though his white companions abandoned
this last vestige of respectability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toilet&mdash;When well he bathed nearly every day, and he
always washed his hands before meals. He was very tidy and
cleanly in all his personal habits. When camping, he was the
only man in our outfit who got up regularly and bathed in the
cold mountain stream every morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ishi was an expert swimmer.... He used a side stroke
and sometimes a modified breast stroke, but no overhand or
fancy strokes; nor did he dive. He swam under water with
great facility and for long distances. The rapids of Deer
Creek were rather full yet he swam them, and carried my young
son hanging to his hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he was sick he resented being bathed except when
ordered by the nurse or doctor. Like many other primitive
people, he considered bathing injurious in the presence of
fever. He never attempted to take a sweat bath while in
civilization, but often spoke of them. I never saw him brush
his teeth, but he rubbed them with his finger, and they always
seemed clean. He washed his mouth out with water after
meals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His beard was sparse but he plucked it systematically
by catching individual hairs between the blade of a dull jack-knife
and his thumb. In his native state he used a sort of
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
tweezers made of a split piece of wood. He did this work
without the use of a mirror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He combed and brushed his hair daily. He washed it
frequently.... At first he had no dandruff, but after two or
three years&rsquo; contact with the whites he had some dry seborrhoea,
and began to get a trifle gray at the temples ... he
used grease on his scalp when in his native state; whereas
bay leaves and bay nuts he said were heated and reduced to
a semi-solid state, when they were rubbed on the body after
the sweat bath. Here they acted as a soporific, or, as he said,
like whiskey, and the person thus anointed fell into a sweet
slumber. The same substance was rubbed on moccasins to
make them waterproof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On one occasion he contracted ring worm, probably from
a wandering cat. He was given a sulphur salve for this, and
after its cure he still used the ointment to soften his hands....
He was not susceptible to &lsquo;poison oak&rsquo; ... nor to sunburn.
His skin bleached out considerably while in San Francisco,
and became darker when exposed to sunlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;... (he) seemed to have the same fondness for sweet-scented
soap that Orientals manifest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His personal belongings he kept in a most orderly manner,
everything in his box being properly folded and arranged with
care. Articles which he kept outside of this box he wrapped
in newspaper and laid in systematic arrangement on shelves
in his room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In working on arrows or flaking obsidian, he was careful
to place newspapers on the floor to catch his chips. In fact,
neatness and order seemed to be part of his self-education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the preparation of food and the washing of dishes he
was very orderly and clean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diet&mdash;... After a certain period of this luxury (eating
heavily) he discerned the folly of this course and began eating
less, when his metabolism returned to a more normal
balance. Part of this increase was due to the large quantities
of water he drank. Being unaccustomed to salt, our seasoning
was excessive and led to increased hydration of his bodily
tissues. He had a great fondness for sweets.... He tried
and liked nearly all kinds of foods, but seemed to have an
aversion for custards, blanc manges, and similar slimy confections,
nor could he be persuaded to drink milk. He
contended that this was made for babies, while he said that
butter ruined the singing voice....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;Matches he took up with evident delight; they were such
a contrast to the laborious methods of the fire drill, or of
nursing embers, which he employed in the wilds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;... His meat he boiled only about ten minutes, eating
it practically without seasoning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His own food in the wilds seems to have been fish, game,
acorn meal, berries, and many roots. Prominent among these
latter was the bulb of the <i>Brodiaea</i>. The Indian could go out
on an apparently barren hillside and with a sharp stick dig up
enough <i>Brodiaea</i> bulbs in an hour to furnish food for a good
meal. These roots are globular in shape, with the appearance
of an onion, ranging in size from a cherry to a very small
potato. The flavor when raw is like that of a potato, and when
cooked like a roasted chestnut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alcohol&mdash;... Ishi himself had no liking for strong
drink, although at one time he purchased a few bottles of beer
and drank small quantities diluted with sugar and water. He
called it medicine. His response to my query regarding
whiskey was, &lsquo;Whiskey-tee crazy-aunatee, die man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tobacco&mdash;Occasionally Ishi smoked a cigarette, and
he knew the use of tobacco, having had access to the native
herb in the wilds. But he seldom smoked more than a few
cigarettes a day, and frequently went weeks without any. He
disapproved of young people smoking. He chewed tobacco at
times, and spat copiously. Both of these indulgences, however,
he resorted to only when invited by some congenial
friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Etiquette&mdash;Although uncultured, he very quickly learned
the proper use of knife, fork, and spoon. His table manners
were of the very best. He often ate at my home, where he was
extremely diffident; watched what others did and then followed
their examples, using great delicacy of manner. His attitude
toward my wife or any other woman member of the household
was one of quiet disinterest. Apparently his sense of propriety
prompted him to ignore her. If spoken to, he would
reply with courtesy and brevity, but otherwise he appeared
not to see her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he wanted to show his disapproval of anything very
strongly, he went through the pantomime of vomiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thrift&mdash;As janitor in the Museum, he was making a
competent income, understood the value of money, was very
thrifty and saving, and looked forward to the day when he
could buy a horse and wagon. This seemed to be the acme
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
of worldly possession to him. He was very happy and well
contented, working a little, playing enough, and surrounded
by friends.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>&ldquo;ISHI&rsquo;S DISPOSITION AND MENTALITY&rdquo;</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Disposition&mdash;In disposition the Yahi was always calm
and amiable. Never have I seen him vehement or angry. Upon
rare occasions he showed that he was displeased. If someone
who he thought had no privilege touched his belongings, he
remonstrated with some show of excitement. Although he had
lived in part by stealing from the cabins of men who had
usurped his country, he had the most exacting conscience
concerning the ownership of property. He would never think
of touching anything that belonged to another person, and
even remonstrated with me if I picked up a pencil that belonged
to one of the Museum force. He was too generous with
his gifts of arms, arrow-heads, and similar objects of his
handicraft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His temperament was philosophical, analytical, reserved,
and cheerful. He probably looked upon us as extremely smart.
While we knew many things, we had no knowledge of nature,
no reserve; we were all busy-bodies. We were, in fact,
sophisticated children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His conception of immortality was that of his tribe, but
he seemed to grasp the Christian concept and asked me many
questions concerning the hereafter. He rather doubted that
the White God cared much about having Indians with Him, and
he did not seem to feel that women were properly eligible to
Heaven. He once saw a moving picture of the Passion Play.
It affected him deeply. But he misconstrued the crucifixion
and assumed that Christ was a &lsquo;bad man&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use of tools&mdash;He was quite adept in the use of such
simple tools as a knife, handsaw, file, and hatchet. He early
discovered the advantages of a small bench vise, and it took
the place of his big toe in holding objects thereafter....
Journeys were measured by days or sleeps ... (he) was
awe-struck when I took him to a sawmill where large cedar
logs were brought in and rapidly sawed up into small bits to
be used in making lead pencils. It would have taken hours
for him to fell even a small tree, and an interminable length
of time to split it. But here was a miracle of work done in a
few minutes. It impressed him greatly....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>In concluding remarks on Indian conflict with pioneer, a word
concerning Indian reservations will not be amiss. The author does
best again in quoting, this time from Kroeber:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The first reservations established by Federal officers in
California were little else than bull pens. They were founded
on the principle, not of attempting to do something for the
native, but of getting him out of the white man&rsquo;s way as
cheaply and hurriedly as possible. The reason that the high
death rate that must have prevailed among these makeshift
assemblages was not reported on more emphatically is that
the Indians kept running away even faster than they could die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The few reservations that were made permanent have on
the whole had a conserving influence on the population after
they once settled into a semblance of reasonable order. They
did little enough for the Indian directly; but they gave him a
place which he could call his own, and where he could exist
in security and in contact with his own kind....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite certain undesirable features of Indian Reservations, the
general conclusion is that for a number of tribes survival has been
considerably greater today than would have been the case if the
Indians had had to shift for themselves in competition with the
whites.</p>

<br />HUNTING</h2>
<p>Hunting was obviously a very important activity of the Lassen
Indians, not only for survival, but as a means of acquiring the comfort
and security which success brought. Also a good hunter was
held in high esteem socially.</p>
<p>Deer were most sought and the hunter went to considerable effort
to get &ldquo;deer power&rdquo; (a sort of guardian spirit) to possess him.
This gave him skill and good luck. Generally only men hunted,
sometimes individually, at other times in small or large groups.</p>
<p>Before going hunting tobacco was often smoked ceremonially
with prayers and singing while the shaman (medicine man) supervised
and the hunters&rsquo; bodies were anointed with medicine. Weapons
to be used were smoked over a fire, while the hunters talked to
their bows and arrows about the coming hunt. Frequently Atsugewi,
Yana, and Yahi hunters also cut themselves until they bled. This
was true especially if their marksmanship had not been good of
late. Cuts were made in the forearm and charcoal was rubbed in.
They often took sweat baths too before hunting, but the Maidu did
not. The latter, however, offered shell beads to help increase deer
power. Atsugewi hunters left offerings of paint, tobacco, and eagle-down
at certain spots in the mountains for luck.</p>
<p>After a youth killed his first game, Maidu and Atsugewi switched
him, a bow string being commonly used. Then the Atsugewi father
talked to his son, blew smoke on him, and sent him out alone into
the mountains for at least five days to seek power. Yana and Yahi
youths were not permitted to touch, skin, or eat any of their first
kill of each kind of animal, lest it spoil their luck. In these tribes
the father skinned the animal and dressed the hide, teaching his
son how this was done.</p>
<p>After hunting there were often cleansing activities and ceremonies,
and usually a division of meat although a lone hunter could
retain all of it. It was considered quite bad to come home empty
handed. After a bear had been killed he was spoken to kindly and
in sympathetic terms. Deer eyes were often eaten to give good
sharp eyesight to the eater.</p>
<p>In a popular method of deer hunting by all Indians of the Lassen
area, a deer head disguise was worn by the hunter. He approached
his quarry cautiously using screening bushes and moving his
antlered head above them to simulate a buck feeding. Sometimes
the hunter carried brush along in front of himself. The mountain
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
Maidu always used the whole deerskin for disguise. When close
enough the hunter would shoot with bow and arrow. Since this was a
nearly silent weapon, there was no noise to startle the deer, and
so it was sometimes possible to slay two or three deer on one
occasion.</p>
<p>Atsugewi hunters might encircle a small brush covered or wooded
mountain. They set many fires, leaving non-burning gaps where
bowmen hid in holes. The deer were shot as they came out of the
burning area.</p>
<p>Mountain Maidu sometimes concealed themselves in pits near
deer licks where they shot the animals in moonlight.</p>
<p>Another hunting method was to drive deer along fences built
of brush or stone or along ropes to which bunches of tules were tied
as hanging streamers. Strategically placed hunters in shallow pits
shot the driven deer as they passed through openings which had
been left. Dogs were frequently used in hunting out and in driving
deer.</p>
<p>The brush deer-blind along a well traveled deer trail was used
too, as well as hanging a noose in the deer trail to snare the deer.
Still another means of taking deer was like that of the northern
neighbors of the Atsugewi, the Pit River Tribe or Achomawi. They
employed a six or seven foot deep pit about nine feet long dug
with slightly undercut side walls. This opening was covered and
concealed with poles, brush, and dirt. As the deer trotted along
established trails over the disguised pitfalls they fell through.
Or, deer might be driven to such pits, sometimes with the aid of
converging walls or fences in conjunction with pitfalls. Deer
trapped in these pitfalls were killed by strangling from above with
ropes.</p>
<p>Another popular way to secure deer was to follow the animal for
one or more days. The pursuing Indian carried a small amount of
food which he ate to sustain himself while moving. The deer, although
swifter afoot than the hunter, was persistently followed at
a steady pace. The animal did not get a chance to feed properly
nor to rest. At length the deer became weakened to the point where
the hunter could approach and shoot it at close range.</p>
<p>If a hunter were fairly close to a deer and it was moving, he
might shout at it, causing the deer to stop momentarily out of
curiosity. This provided a better chance of bringing the quarry
down with bow and arrow. Deer were sometimes lured closer by
whistling with lips, blowing on a leaf or grass blade held in the
hands, or by imitating the cry of a fawn. A hunter is said occasionally
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
to have been able to sing to a group of deer, holding their
attention while he cautiously approached within arrow range.</p>
<p>If practical, deer or other game was killed by driving the animals
over cliffs. Elk, mountain sheep, antelope, and reportedly occasionally
even bison were hunted by one or more of the means. Except
for the case of mountain sheep, such animals were probably rare
within the territories of the tribes being considered.</p>
<p>Meat of such large game was prepared for eating after skinning
by roasting in the earth pit ovens to be described in succeeding
chapters or by cutting up and boiling. Much venison and the like
was also stored for winter use. In this case the meat was cut into
strips and dried in the sun or on wooden frames over fires. This
was not a smoking, but rather a drying process. Such jerked meat
was stored in large, tightly woven baskets. Meat fresh or dried was
almost invariably eaten with acorn mush.</p>
<p>Bear hunting was common among tribes of the Lassen area. The
American Black Bear is not aggressive and by no means always
black. He is of moderately large size and often is light or dark
brown in color. Indians liked to hunt the Black Bear in winter,
two hunters entering the hibernating den. One carried a torch and
the other a bow and arrow. They rolled a large block of wood in
front of them and shot the bear at point blank range, then quickly
ran out. Wounded, frightened, and in a semi-stupor, the bear usually
stumbled over the wooden block. If he did not die in the den, but
came out, he was shot by other waiting hunters. Mountain Maidu
instead of entering the den smoked the bear out with pitchy torches
planted at the den entrance.</p>
<p>The California Grizzly was much larger, fiercer, and more
aggressive. This grizzly is now extinct, but was common especially
in the foothill and lower mountain slopes of California before the
coming of the white man. Grizzlies were normally engaged only
by a large group of hunters and after considerable ceremonial preparation.
Hunters never entered the den. Two stout poles were
crossed in front of the opening with one or two men holding each&mdash;a
dangerous job. The bear was spoken to nicely and urged to
come out which he usually soon did. As the bear started to climb
over the poles at the den entrance, the Indians pushed up forcing
the bear&rsquo;s body against the roof so that he could most easily be
shot. If this maneuver was not successful, a brave hunter enticed
the bear to pursue him while the others shot arrows into the grizzly.
Especially sharp and heavily poisoned arrow points were used on
grizzly bear by the Atsugewi.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>It was believed that a man who drank fresh bear blood would be
very healthy thereafter, if he were strong enough. If he were weak,
however, drinking the blood would kill him promptly.</p>
<p>Mountain lion were tracked, sometimes with dogs, sometimes in
the snow, then treed and shot. Wildcats were generally killed in
the same way. A hunter might coax a mountain lion to leap at him
by simulating a deer feeding, using the deer head and skin disguise,
but this was a dangerous practice.</p>
<p>Except in the eastern part of Atsugewi territory where the
Apwaruge lived, rabbits were not plentiful. Yana, Yahi, and Maidu
hunted them more, driving cottontail, snowshoe, and jack rabbits
into long nets and clubbing them to death. In the winter rabbits
were sometimes tracked and shot with bow and untipped arrows.</p>
<p>Other small mammals were shot, caught by dogs, and dug,
smoked, or drowned out of burrows. A stick split at the end was
thrust into a burrow and by twisting was entangled in the creature&rsquo;s
fur sufficiently to drag him out. Ground squirrels could be outrun
and killed by stepping on them. Skunks, badgers, rats, and more
often porcupines were eaten&mdash;the latter being clubbed or stoned
to death.</p>
<p>Small and medium sized animals were also caught under stone
or log deadfalls which were propped up to drop on the victim while
it was traveling along a runway, crossing a stream on a log, or
when the animal pulled on a baited trigger. Similar placing was
used for setting spring snares which took advantage of bent tree
limbs for power. Long fences with nooses placed in gaps were used
for rabbits, quail, and the like, and on occasion for creatures as
large as deer. Some nooses were even operated by hand from a
place of hiding.</p>
<p>Birds of all sorts were caught too, but live or imitation decoys
were never employed as lures. Woodpeckers were removed from the
nest by hand or else a noose was hung around the nest opening.
Some birds were taken in basketry traps. Waterfowl were shot with
bow and arrow and the young were run down. Eggs were also taken.
Some ducks were speared at night from canoes or driven into nets
by use of a canoe with fire at one end. Frequently nets or snares
were suspended at intervals just above a stream where waterfowl
commonly alighted. Ducks and geese were also driven into the
traps in taking off from the water.</p>
<p>Grouse and small birds like robins and blackbirds were shot
with blunt or untipped arrows, usually of one-piece construction.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that in contrast to other local tribes, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
Yana and Yahi tribes did not employ the following hunting techniques:
burning brush, using bird snaring booths, nets for ducks,
geese, rabbits, or deer, nor was game driven into enclosures or
quail secured by use of net traps or drive fences. Furthermore Yana
and Yahi did not believe that game was immortal.</p>

<p class="pcap">Atsugewi Snare set on a log lying across a stream.</p>
</div>
<p>It was not an uncommon practice, especially among the mountain
Maidu, to frequently burn off their lands to make for easier travel
and to minimize the possibility of ambush by enemies. The
frequent &ldquo;light&rdquo; burnings do not seem to have generated enough
heat to have destroyed the forests. Never the less this practice
is not regarded as a wise conservation as it is definitely injurious
to tree and much other plant reproduction as well as being destructive
of organic material in the soil, damaging the watershed and
being unfavorable to certain animal species, as well as accelerating
erosion.</p>

<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">Chapter VII</span>
<br />FISHING</h2>
<p>Fishes were one of the four important food categories consumed
by Indians of the Lassen region. Land-locked and other non-migratory
Rainbow Trout were abundantly available in mountain
streams and in some lakes. Steelhead Trout penetrated the territories
of our four tribes too. Salmon, however, did not go so far
upstream, only rarely coming up Hat Creek, for instance, into
Atsugewi lands. For the most part this tribe of Indians visited the
Pit River to the north in the autumn. They paid the Achomawi,
through whose territory this fine salmon stream flowed, for the
privilege of catching salmon by giving up a share of the catch to
them. The larger streams in south Yana, Yahi, and mountain Maidu
country contained salmon and steelhead, but it seems that these
tribes also made bargains with the Valley Indians for salmon fishing
privileges or else made fishing forays to the Sacramento River.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">

<p class="pcap">Atsugewi Bow-type net.
This kind was usually used
in small streams where it
covered the full width of the
stream bed. Fish were
commonly driven into it,
then the handle was raised.</p>
</div>
<p>Gill nets about three feet high and as much as 30 feet long were
commonly used. Spawning trout in the spring were speared in large
numbers. Although old informants have denied the practice,
Boonookoo-ee-menorra (Mrs. Selina La Marr of the Atsugewi) tells
of catching Rainbow Trout by hand from Manzanita Creek banks
about fifty years ago when her family came up in the summer to
fish. Trout were speared by the Atsugewi with two pointed or four
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
pointed spears instead of the common single pointed version. Bone
or Serviceberry wood might be used for the tips. Spears were used
not only from stream banks, but, especially at night, from a canoe
equipped with a torch in front. One man or more would spear the
fish while a person, sometimes a woman, paddled the craft from the
rear. The torch consisted of four mountain-mahogany sticks bound
together with pitch down the center.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="" width="519" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">A northeast Maidu bow-fish
net about forty inches long.
It was used for fish other
than salmon. Northwest and
southern Maidu did not use
such nets, employing seine
nets instead (after Dixon).</p>
</div>
<p>It is interesting to note that the practice of shooting fish with
bow and arrow was not carried on by any tribes of the Lassen area,
although the eastern people of the Pit River Indians (Achomawi),
the western Shasta, Wintu, and foothill Maidu did do so.</p>
<p>Only Atsugewi, of the tribes we are considering, trapped fish
in converging weirs into which fish might be driven. In the autumn,
streams were sometimes diverted by damming. The fish trapped
in the ponds remaining were scooped out with baskets or nets.
Mountain Maidu drove fish into traps and caught lamprey eels in
dip or scoop nets. Bow-type nets illustrated in the text were used
with the bow bent ends down resting on the bed of the stream, the
pole being raised to trap the fish. The net was preferably as wide
as the stream.</p>
<p>All local tribes fished with lines and hooks which were made
by lashing a sharp piece of bone to a section of twig, at an acute
angle. Atsugewi and mountain Maidu also used a &ldquo;gorge&rdquo; for
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
angling. This was a slender piece of bone two or three inches
long fastened near the middle and sharpened at both ends. Hooks
were sometimes baited with meat, grasshoppers, or large flies, but
man-made &ldquo;flies&rdquo; as fishermen know them today were not used.
Sometimes meat or grasshopper bait was used by Atsugewi on fish-lines
without any hook. Atsugewi women occasionally fished with
baskets and with hook and line. Hooks were often tied in a series
on a line attached either on both banks of the stream or to a pole
secured in the bank or tied to tules or to brush, and left over night.
A series of basket traps was sometimes likewise stretched across
a stream.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/p10a.jpg" alt="" width="169" height="500" />
<p class="pcap">A Klamath fish hook similar to those
used by local tribes. Single barbed
hooks were also employed.</p>
</div>
<p>Salmon fishing was done largely with harpoons which differ from
spears in having one or more movable barbs or toggles of bone.
These opened when the harpoon was pulled back (outward in the
victim) thus securing the catch all the more firmly. This was
necessary for such large and heavy fish as salmon. Yana tribes
caught their salmon with either hook and line or by spearing with
a two pointed harpoon.</p>
<p>Natural falls were favored fishing sites. There Indians caught
salmon and steelhead trout as the fish attempted to scale the falls.
Long handled nets were used. Atsugewi went so far as to build
scaffoldings to assist either in this method of fishing or from which
to harpoon large fish. In the latter case many whitish rocks, where
available, were thrown into the stream to build up a light colored
bottom for better visibility in harpooning or spearing.</p>
<p>After the fish were caught they were killed by striking with a
stick as a general practice. Mountain Maidu sometimes killed fish
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
by striking their heads on rocks. The central Yana, interestingly
enough, killed fish by biting them!</p>
<p>In quiet portions of streams fish were poisoned by placing
certain pounded plant materials in the water. Yana and Yahi used
crushed Soaproot; Atsugewi used pulverized Wild Parsley. Wild
Parsley application made the water bluish, and caused the fish
soon to rise to the surface of the water floating belly-up. Where
suitable quiet pools did not exist in a stream, they were sometimes
formed by the Indians through temporary damming. Buckeye nut
pulp, which is poisonous, was not used in this area for poisoning
fish.</p>
<p>Long basketry fish traps, usually constructed by men, were also
utilized. The design and proportions of these varied with the tribe.</p>
<p>Each of the Lassen area tribes had taboos which prevented
youths, and in the case of Atsugewi, their parents too, from eating
the first fish each youth caught.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">

<p class="pcap">Plan of Maidu open basketry fish trap (after Dixon) several feet long.

</div>
<p>Chubs and minnows, spurned by white man, were driven into
nets and eaten. At lower elevations, where waters were warmer
and sluggish, suckers provided a common source of food fish. The
Indians also not infrequently dove for crawfish and fresh water
mussels. These were gathered in net sacks by male Indians of all
local tribes. Yana and Yahi roasted mussels but did not boil them
and never dried them for later use. A flat rock might be carried on
the shoulders to assist the diving Indians.</p>
<p>Some fish were cooked by roasting over coals or by boiling.
Most trout, however, were cleaned, head and backbone removed,
and then strung up on poles to dry. No salt was used in the process.
The dried fish was carried to camp or village in large
baskets. Dried trout was tied into small bales for storage and
placed in baskets or in pits dug in the ground for safe-keeping.
Salmon were usually cooked in earth pit ovens, then dried and
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
crumbed by Atsugewi and mountain Maidu for later use. This was
of necessity an autumnal activity. Yana and Yahi stored their
salmon in dried slabs, pulverizing it as needed.</p>

<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">Chapter VIII</span>
<br />GATHERING AND PREPARATION OF OTHER FOODS</h2>
<p>As has been pointed out earlier under &ldquo;California Indians&rdquo;,
these tribes had a common food pattern. Although there was some
difference in the relative importance of the four major types of food
to the several tribes due to varying availability, the California
Indians ate (1) game, especially deer, (2) fish, particularly salmon
and trout, (3) roots and bulbs which the women dug, and (4) fruits
and seeds of a wide variety, the most important of which were
acorns.</p>
<p>Besides fish and venison, many kinds of flesh food were eaten
by the Indians of the Lassen area: fox, wolf, grizzly and black
bear, skunk, raccoon, porcupine, rabbit, owl, fish, fresh water
mussel, and turtle being most common. They also ate with apparent
relish a variety of insects and the like including crickets,
grasshoppers, angleworms, red ant eggs, and yellow-jacket larvae.</p>
<p>Game which was not eaten by either Atsugewi or mountain Maidu
was coyote, elk, antelope, and all snakes and lizards. The last
two items were almost universally shunned by California Indians.
Many California tribes including Yana and Yahi refused to eat dog
meat, some of them believing canine flesh to be poisonous. That
mountain Maidu was one of the few tribes which ate dog flesh whenever
it was available is denied by Dixon. Atsugewi ate it only as
a last resort when rare, near-famine conditions prevailed or during
times of severe epidemic. Canine flesh was believed by them to
be a powerful and perhaps somewhat dangerous medicine. Buzzards
seem to have been about the only birds which were not eaten.</p>
<p>Each tribe had certain taboos on eating game. An Atsugewi
did not, for example, eat wildcat, gopher, hawk, lamprey eel, or
caterpillars. Mountain Maidu did not eat mountain lion, badger,
raven, or crawfish.</p>
<p>Heart of deer was taboo to all males among Atsugewi and to
all children and youths of the mountain Maidu. The foetus of all
animals and also deer fawns could not be eaten by any except
Atsugewi, Yana, and Yahi old men and old women. Animal foetus
was, however, allowed as food to all mountain Maidu adults. Bear
foetus was skinned by Atsugewi and fed to old women because it
was so tender. Likewise, Yana and Yahi made foetus soup for old
folks to eat. Deer liver was taboo to Atsugewi boys and youths.
Taboo also among Atsugewi was the eating of fish and deer meat
together. Among mountain Maidu the eating of salt on bear meat
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
was prohibited. Many other food combinations were outlawed by
these and other California tribes.</p>
<p>Deer backbone was ground up and eaten dry by mountain Maidu
or molded into small cakes, then baked and eaten while Atsugewi
would dry deer backbones with meat still adhering, grind it up, and
then boil the meal before eating it. Yana also ate pulverized meal
of other bones after cooking. Marrow was relished; it was a special
delicacy for Yana children.</p>
<p>Securing of large game and fish and their preparation has been
described earlier.</p>
<p>Such animals as wildcat, raccoons, foxes, et cetera were skinned
and cooked in earth ovens by all local tribes. These were pits
sometimes as much as six feet wide and lined with rocks. A large
fire was built in the pit to thoroughly heat the rock lining, after
which any unburned debris was removed. The animal to be roasted
was laid in the pit on a layer of green pine needles, or various
other leaves, depending upon the tribe. A large heated rock was
placed inside the body cavity and smaller hot rocks were wedged
under the fore and hind legs which were then all tied tightly together.
A flat heated rock might be placed on top of the carcass
and the whole was covered with pine needles and the like, and
finally with hot ashes and sometimes dirt. The roasting proceeded
for half a day or so. Blood and fat might be placed in the intestine
membranes of larger animals (especially wildcat) to form sausage
and cooked in ashes. Mountain Maidu also boiled blood for eating.</p>
<p>Quills of porcupine and hair of badger, squirrel, or other small
mammals might be singed off before cooking instead of skinning the
animals. Ground squirrels were sometimes merely gutted and then
roasted in ashes without further preparation. When Yana (and probably
Yahi) did this, they then skinned the ground squirrels after
cooking and mashed the whole bodies by pounding before eating
them. Rabbits were roasted over coals and broken into pieces for
eating. Both mountain Maidu and Atsugewi sometimes broiled small
mammals on a single stick over coals.</p>
<p>Turtles were cooked alive in hot ashes. If they crawled out
they were pushed back in again.</p>
<p>Duck eggs were boiled in baskets using hot rocks&mdash;cooked
they would keep for a week or two. Yana tribes roasted quail eggs
in ashes. Birds were gutted, feathers singed off in flames and
roasted on sticks or roasted in oven pits. Roasting was invariably
used for the large birds such as ducks, geese, and swans.</p>
<p>Atsugewi practiced some fascinating gathering techniques in
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
which they were not unique. Insects were gathered by both men
and women. Grasshoppers and crickets not infrequently appeared
in large numbers. These were collected early in the morning while
still sluggish with cold. When very abundant they were scraped with
sticks from branches of bushes into large burden baskets. During
the heat of the day grasshoppers were effectively collected by
singeing them. Some tribes merely burned dry grassy fields after
which the insects were easily picked up. Atsugewi made a long
willow &ldquo;rope&rdquo; to which many bunches of dry grass were fastened.
This was set afire and men carrying this blazing band stretched
tightly between them ran across open grassland where the grasshoppers
were numerous. The insects jumped into the flames and
were thus killed. Yana pulverized grasshoppers and other insects
without cooking them.</p>
<p>Atsugewi roasted crickets in the pit oven. These were then
dried two days and finally eaten or stored. If they had been stored,
they were pounded before being eaten.</p>
<p>Salmon flies were plentiful along Pit River and Lost Creek (outside
of the park). These were hand picked from the banks early in
the morning. The wings were removed and the bodies boiled before
eating by the Atsugewi.</p>
<p>When yellow-jackets, always carnivorous (meat eaters), were
seen buzzing about, Atsugewi would tie a white flower petal to
a grasshopper leg. When the yellow-jacket picked this morsel up
and flew away with it toward its nest, the Indians would run after
the yellow-jacket which was easy to follow on account of the conspicuous
flower petal it carried along. Thus yellow-jacket nests
were found. A line was marked around the nest area with the
fingers. This line was supposed to increase the size of the nest.
Pine needles were then stacked over the nest and burned to kill
the winged insects. This done, the nest was dug up and roasted
alongside a fire, thus cooking the maggot-like grubs inside. These
were considered to be quite a delicacy. According to Dixon,
mountain Maidu young folks were denied this delicacy, but not so
among the Yana. Dried grasshoppers, crickets, and yellow-jacket
larvae were foods often used as items of trade.</p>
<p>Angleworms were collected by first driving a digging stick a
few inches into the moist soil, then moving the top about. The
consequent disturbing of the ground made the worms crawl out.
Although other California tribes made angleworm soup, Atsugewi,
Yana, and probably Yahi sometimes roasted angleworms between
hot rocks. Maidu reportedly dried worms for eating.</p>
<p>Red ant eggs were eaten by Indians too. Atsugewi baked them
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
in earth pit ovens, while mountain Maidu parched them with coals.
Mountain Maidu also ate certain caterpillars, but the other tribes
of the Lassen area did not.</p>

<p>Indians of this region did not carry on any agriculture, that is
they did not plant crops for food or other purposes, but collected
those which grew wild. It was, however, a common practice to burn
some areas over regularly to stimulate growth of edible seed producing
plants. Women always gathered the vegetable materials and
prepared them for use.</p>
<p>Roots and bulbs provided vital foods to the aborigines also.
These were procured with a digging stick. In this region it was
blunt at the top with a tapered point at the digging end. Atsugewi
fastened a short cross piece on top to serve as a handle. The
digging stick was made by this tribe of green mountain-mahogany
wood with the digging point hardened by scorching in the flame.

After the coming of white man, the same design was retained, but
an iron rod replaced the mountain-mahogany digging shaft.</p>
<p>In use, the digging stick was thrust into the ground next to the
plant whose root was to be secured. The handle portion was worked
sideways a couple of times, then pulled downward toward the
operator. The point very effectively brought the root out of the
ground. Roots were customarily tossed into a large cone-shaped
carrying basket which was held in place on the digging woman&rsquo;s
back by a chest band over her chest. Some of the load in the basket
might also be supported by a band from the basket over the Indian
woman&rsquo;s forehead.</p>
<p>Roots were cleaned by rubbing (sometimes with sand) in a shallow
bowl-shaped basket of a rough coarse mesh weave of willow
ribs, like that used for cleaning acorns. The whole was dipped in
water frequently. Rubbing usually continued until the skins were
entirely removed.</p>
<p>The most important item of this type collected in large amount
for food is known as epos locally, or &ldquo;peh-ts-koo&rdquo; among the old
Atsugewi. The plant belongs to the parsley family and stands one
to two feet high. Actually, probably more than one species was
eaten by Indians of the Lassen area. These plants are not unlike
except in detail. All had sweet carrot-like taproots about two
inches long. Garth states that Atsugewi ate the species <i>Pteridendia
bolanden</i> which apparently corresponds to the botanists&rsquo; <i>Perideridia
bolanderi</i> or <i>Eulophus bolanderi</i>; also probably <i>Carum</i> or <i>Perideridia
oregona</i> and <i>californica</i>. Common English names for epos are squaw
root or yampah. Epos roots were dried and stored, then ground up
for use. This food item was made into either soup or bread. The
finished product had a fine sweet meaty or nutty taste, and was
held in high esteem. Obviously this constituted an important
vegetable in the diet.</p>
<p>At least two kinds of camas bulbs and <i>brodeia</i> bulbs were
roasted in the earth pit oven, ground to pulp, shaped into cakes,
and rebaked. These were then either eaten or dried and stored.
The latter process was not employed by mountain Maidu. If the
baked camas cakes were stored, they would be soaked with water
before eating. Camas cakes were not made into soup.</p>
<p>Tiger lily bulbs were roasted in earth pit ovens and eaten
immediately. They were a highly prized food.</p>
<p>Wild onion was used too, but usually with other root foods as
a flavoring.</p>
<p>The foregoing are but a few of the most extensively eaten roots.
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
Many others, especially those of the lily and parsley families,
were used by tribes of the Lassen region.</p>
<p>Yana tribes robbed gophers of stores of edible roots and bulbs.
These were found by probing for burrows and digging out the
animals&rsquo; food storage chambers. Men usually did this, which is an
exception to the general rule that women only collected vegetable
materials.</p>
<p>Acorns were probably the most important single food of California
Indians. Surprisingly, this was true even in eastern parts of
the territories of the Atsugewi (Apwaruge), mountain Maidu, and
others where acorns were scarce or wanting entirely. Indians
frequently traded for acorns or made long journeys for them. Acorns
of the black oak were generally preferred over other kinds. Nearly
all varieties were used for food on occasion, however. It is interesting
to note that Modoc and Klamath Indians were exceptions
in not using acorns for food.</p>
<p>In the fall, usually in September, acorns were gathered by women
after the ripe nuts had been knocked from the oaks with long poles,
or by men and young agile girls climbing the trees to strike the
fruit with straight sticks or staves. To aid in climbing large smooth
tree trunks, Atsugewi men used sapling ladders on which part of
branches were left attached to serve for footholds. Mountain Maidu
on the other hand used a very unique two poled ladder with buckskin
rungs. Acorns were carried to villages by women in stages,
using baskets about the size of nail kegs.</p>
<p>First spring food gathering each year was marked by rites in
which the shamans, or medicine men, conducted praying ceremonies.
Atsugewi conducted three of these. In May first epos roots were
gathered and sung over by shamans. They examined the roots and
prophesied whether the women who had dug them were going to be
sick. Those who were going to be sick dug roots all day. In the
evening these were dumped into piles and women shamans sang
over these for half the night to make the threatened women healthy.
Each woman gatherer participating then took home the roots she
had dug leaving some for the shamans, who cooked and ate them.
A second first food ceremony consisted of a ceremonial feast of
fruit and vegetable materials with fish which the men brought.
In the third such rite, root digging women threw away the first roots
they dug that season and prayed to the effect: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me
poor. Give me good luck. You may have this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In autumn, mountain Maidu held their first fruit ceremonies.
Large groups of women went out to gather acorns. Acorn mush was
made immediately of the first batch collected. The shamans ate
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
some and prayed. Portions of this batch were then eaten by the
rest of the assemblage. After that it was all right for anyone to
gather and to use acorns of the new crop.</p>
<p>Local tribes stored acorns in the shell either indoors in large
baskets or outside in pits or in large hoppers or granaries covered
with bark. The details of these varied with the several tribes.
Maidu except for the &ldquo;mountain tribe&rdquo; and Yana shelled, split,
and slightly dried some of their acorns, and placed them in basketry
storage bins lined with broadleafed maple leaves. Maidu ate
twelve different kinds of acorns, but the favorites were the black
oak (<i>Quercus kelloggii</i>), <i>golden cup oak</i> maul, or canyon oak
(<i>Quercus chrysolepis</i>), and sierra live oak (<i>Quercus wislizenii</i>)
acorns.</p>
<p>In preparation, acorns were cracked by up-ending each on a
flat rock and striking the point with any convenient small stone.
Sometimes small acorns were cracked with the teeth. Though
usually a woman&rsquo;s job, young folks and men might help with the
task.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">
<img src="images/p13.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="473" />
<p class="pcap">Basaltic lava mortar from Yana territory, about ten inches high.</p>
</div>
<p>The thin brownish skin which covers the acorn kernels was removed
by rubbing vigorously in rough porous baskets made entirely
of willow ribs. Water was not used. Indians of the Lassen area
did not employ stone mortars for grinding acorns as was the practice
in other parts of California. Stone mortars were always found, not
made, and were used for ceremonial purposes, in the belief that
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
these had been made by Coyote. However, Maidu families cherished
portable stone mortars. They were kept buried at some distance
from the dwelling, and dug up for occasional inspection. Bed-rock
acorn pounding holes are not found in this region either except for
the Maidu area. Instead, acorn meats were placed in hopper baskets
lacking bottoms. This basketry mortar hopper rested with the small
open end down on a heavy flat stone. The pounding basket was
held in place by the Indian woman&rsquo;s knees as she sat in front of
and straddling it. In one hand she wielded a stone pestle, flat on
the grinding end. With the other hand she stirred the acorn material
so that the coarse pieces worked toward the center to get the full
impact of the pounding. The hopper basket was not always used,
by the mountain Maidu, the pounding often being done merely on a
flat rock slab, the woman&rsquo;s free hand continually brushing the
acorn material back to the center. Acorn meal was ground until it
was as fine as flour. The coarse pieces were separated from the
fine by a process which employed a flattish piece of wood or bark
a foot or so across. Sometimes a basketry plaque was used. A
portion of ground meal was placed on this tray which was held
firmly at one side and inclined toward the operator. The other edge
of the plaque was shaken, causing the coarse material to roll into
a container held in the lap for repounding while the fine flour remained
on the plaque. A small brush, generally made from the
pounded and dried root of the soap-plant, was used to brush the
flour off and into the cooking basket. Mountain Maidu, according
to Voegelin, actually did sift acorn meal through open-work baskets
though this was not a common practice even among members of
this tribe.</p>
<p>White oak and some other acorn flour could be used for cooking
without further preparation. Atsugewi preferred black oak acorns
which had to be leached to remove the bitter tannic acid before
using. To do this the flour was placed in a shallow depression on
clean sand over porous earth, usually, but Yana used loosely
woven baskets for the purpose, and in recent times it has become
common practice to place cloth flour sacking over a screen or
sieve. Cold water was poured over the meal until it was nearly
free of bitterness. Warm water was then employed briefly, but hot
water was never used, for it would make the flour tend to jell.
Sand was removed from the bottom of the flour by touching the
bottom of a handful of the moist material to water. The flour held
together, but the sand grains dropped off. The flour could be dried
and stored at this point, but was usually used as it was prepared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Portions of about two or three quarts of acorn flour were placed
in cooking baskets a foot or more in diameter. Water was added
and then hot stones were dropped in. These smoothly rounded
stones, of any shape and from one and a half to three inches in
diameter, had been heated in an open fire. They were quickly dipped
into water to remove ashes before being put into the mush cooking
basket. The method of handling these cooking stones seems to
have varied. Present day Atsugewi say a small looped stick was
used, but old informants stated that two forked sticks were employed.
Stirring had to be continuous lest the cooking stones scorch
the basket. Atsugewi used any convenient stick for this, but Yana
had a small oak paddle. After boiling a short while the acorn mush
became light greyish or brownish in color; when cooled it jellied
quite firmly. Acorn mush was commonly eaten warm with meat,
from small individual baskets. Spoons were unknown in the Lassen
area so acorn mush was eaten with index and second fingers.
Mountain Maidu made their acorn mush of a more liquid consistency
so that it was often consumed by drinking.</p>
<p>Acorn bread was made by using less water and adding a small
amount of reddish iron-bearing or blackish salt-bearing soil by
Atsugewi, but mountain Maidu left this ingredient out. The paste
was molded into biscuit or loaf-shaped forms, wrapped in leaves
and baked all night in earth pit ovens. Yana sometimes added red
soil to their acorn bread making it brightly colored. Usually black
oak acorns were used for bread by the Yana tribes and white oak
for soup.</p>
<p>That acorns are a fine food is indicated by the following analysis
of the uncooked meal. The proportions vary somewhat, but not
importantly among the several kinds of acorns used: 21% fat, 5%
protein, 62% carbohydrate, and 14% water, mineral, and fiber. In
cooked acorn mush the proportions remain the same relatively, except,
of course, for the greatly increased water content.</p>
<p>Buckeye nuts, not used much by Atsugewi, were important to
other Indians of California, especially those residing at lower
elevations. These fruits were gathered when ripe, then shelled,
pounded and soaked in loosely woven baskets until the poisonous
juice was leached out. The pulpy mass was next squeezed to remove
excess water. Unlike acorn meal buckeye pulp was eaten
uncooked. Yana crushed their buckeyes with their feet and leached
the material in creeks, though sometimes hot water was used.</p>
<p>Nuts of digger pine and sugar pine were highly regarded as food.
Men climbed trees and picked digger pine cones or shook limbs to
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
dislodge sugar pine cones. The cones were placed on end and
covered with dry grass which was burned, ridding the cones of
pitch. After this heat treatment, sugar pine nuts came out easily
when cone scales were pulled back. After singeing the heavy
digger pine cones were hit with rocks to obtain the large nuts they
contained.</p>
<p>The white sweet crusty deposit occasionally found on the bark
of sugar pines was relished as candy by Atsugewi. However, it had
a laxative property which mountain Maidu recognized and reputedly
employed as such.</p>
<p>A variety of small plant seeds also provided tasty nutrition.
Several members of the sunflower family including balsam root
species and mules ears, and others were used by all local tribes.
Such seeds were usually collected by beating them with paddle-shaped
basketry seed beaters into burden baskets. They were then
parched with coals in flat trays, placed in flat baskets and worked
about with stones until freed of skins. Seeds were winnowed by
tossing them up allowing wind to carry hulls and skins away. The
seeds were then pulverized with a small stone or muller, being
rolled or rubbed on a larger rock slab generally referred to as a
metate. Such seeds were eaten dry by Atsugewi, Yana, and Yahi
without grinding, or the flour might be moistened and molded into
cakes about the size of biscuits and eaten without further cooking.
However, Yana also cooked certain sunflower seeds and the yellow
blossoming heads of the small (<i>Helianthella</i>) sunflower were themselves
cooked and eaten.</p>
<p>Clover tops were collected in summer and eaten fresh by all
local tribes. Mountain Maidu also baked them in earth pit ovens,
then dried and stored the material to be recooked in winter for
making soup. Atsugewi cooked clover roots in ovens. Young thistle
stalks were eaten raw as was the foliage of several carrot-like
plants. Mushrooms, fresh, roasted, or dried were eaten also. Young
soap-plant stems were eaten fresh or baked and dried for winter
use by Yana tribes.</p>
<p>Manzanita berries were gathered by all Indians of the Lassen
region in July and August. These berries were knocked into burden
baskets with a stick. They were dried, stored in pits, pounded
when needed, and sifted as fine meal. This was moistened and
molded into biscuit-sized cakes and put away until wanted. Either
fresh flour or the cakes were eaten plain or put into water and
drunk. One investigator reported fermentation of manzanita cider
and its use as a mild intoxicant, but this appears to have been the
exception rather than the rule. The drink, of lemonade-like character,
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
was usually consumed fresh. Manzanita cider was conveyed
to the mouth by dipping a deer tail sop into the liquid, and then by
sucking it. Small cakes were made of a mixture of manzanita and
wild plum flours. Yana and Yahi also ate manzanita berries as such
either fresh, or roasted and dried.</p>
<p>Red berries of skunk or squaw bush were gathered in midsummer,
washed, dried, and stored. They were pounded into flour in a mortar
basket, mixed with manzanita flour and drunk. Elderberries were
mashed and mixed with manzanita flour and stored as cakes.</p>
<p>Wild plums were prepared by removing seeds. These were then
eaten fresh or dried for storage.</p>
<p>Chokecherries and service berries were put into baskets when
ripe and mashed. The paste was eaten without cooking.</p>
<p>Gooseberries, huckleberries, currants, Oregon-grape, buckthorn,
juniper, thimble, and elderberries were eaten fresh, too, but juniper
fruits might be dried and pounded into flour and stored.</p>
<p>Another item used as food was salt which mountain Maidu and
Yana gathered locally in mineral form. The Atsugewi also imported
it from Round Mountain in North Yana territory or made expeditions
to this site to gather the dark salt material from a certain marsh.
This salty earth was shaped into black loaves and dried. It was
not only used for flavoring, but the black soil was also eaten as
such by some individuals. Atsugewi had a local source of salt,
however, by collecting fine whitish crystals in the early mornings
from the blades of salt grass which was run between the fingers.
Atsugewi used salt for salmon and venison in cooking, but not in
drying processes.</p>
<p>Pine pitch was chewed, but Atsugewi also used milkweed chewing
gum.</p>
<p>As for eating customs, Atsugewi ate three meals each day.
Mountain Maidu just prepared two real meals. Hands were washed
after eating deer and bear meats. Mountain Maidu wiped faces and
hands with bark and grass after eating.</p>
<p>There was a well defined division of labor among California
Indians. Men would carry water for unusually long distances or
heavy logs for firewood, but women usually carried water, wood,
acorn and root crops, and the like. In the case of moving camp,
however, men carried the heaviest burdens. The most important
division of labor was the delegation to men of all activities concerning
animals and animal products, and to women all pertaining
to vegetable materials. Women, for instance, collected materials
for basketry and made all the baskets, except that men often made
basketry fish traps and nets. Women dug roots and cooked all food
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
except meat which men normally cooked. Exception to this rule
was necessarily made when men were away on hunting trips or at
war. Men usually built the houses, made moccasins and skin
clothing too.</p>
<p>Among Atsugewi and mountain Maidu only men made fire, but
this was accomplished by both sexes among the Yana and Yahi.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br />HOUSES AND FURNISHINGS</h2>
<p>The Atsugewi used earth-covered lodges as their permanent
winter dwellings. These varied in size from about nine feet in
length, for a single family, to more than thirty feet in length for
a chief&rsquo;s house which was usually larger than other houses. Most
frequently houses were about twenty feet long and somewhat
narrower, being occupied by three to five families. The earth lodge
was elliptical in shape with one center post planted firmly in the
earth floor somewhat back of true center. This supported beams
running to two smaller secondary posts and to earth shoulders
which resulted from excavation of the entire floor to a depth of
about three feet. On the beams other poles or rafters and bark slabs
(usually of incense-cedar) were laid. The whole sloping roof was
then covered with pine needles and a layer of earth.</p>
<p>The main entrance was through a hole about in the center of the
roof. Over this a heavy mat was placed in bad weather. This opening
also served as a smoke hole. A ladder made of two poles with
cross pieces tied on with serviceberry withes was used inside.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">

<dl class="undent pcap"><dt>logs or poles</dt>
<dt>a fireplace</dt>
<dt>b mainpost with forked top</dt>
<dt>c front posts with forked tops</dt></dl>
<p>A secondary entrance of small size, used by children, was built
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
horizontally at ground level on the south (front) end of the house. It
projected tunnel-like a short distance beyond the lodge outside wall.
The main purpose of this ground-level opening was to act as a ventilator
duct to supply draft for proper burning of the cooking and house
warming fire which burned in front of the center post. At night the
ventilator duct was closed. This reduced air supply, causing the
fire to burn very slowly. Glowing coals developed as a result.
These produced reduced but adequate heat for the occupants who
slept with their feet to the fire. Men did all of the house construction
work except for excavation. The women did this with digging
sticks and wooden or basketry scoops with which they threw the
dirt out of the pit. Excavation of the floor of the lodge not only
made it easier to construct a strong house, but contributed materially
to the warmth of the standard winter house.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">
<img src="images/p14a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="613" />
<p class="pcap">Typical winter house of the local permanent Indian villages at lower
elevations.</p>
</div>
<p>There was no furniture as such. Each family used an assigned
portion of the house, and cooked its own food, but utilized the
central communal fire. A thin layer of grass, carefully kept away
from the fire, covered the floor. The Indians slept on the floor on
mats made of tule. During the day these and the sleeping blankets
were rolled up and provided the only seats. However, sitting
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
usually consisted of squatting on the floor.</p>
<p>Blankets of deer and elk skin were generally used. Atsugewi
also used loose tule or grass blankets and all our tribes employed
both woven rabbit skin and patchwork rabbit or fox blankets. Yana
in addition to all the foregoing utilized bear skins; sometimes they
removed the hair from their blankets.</p>
<p>Atsugewi pillows were of bundles of leaves or grass while those
of the mountain Maidu were harder, being merely piles of small
poles, blocks of wood, or rocks.</p>
<p>Interior earth walls of the houses were sometimes hung with tule
mats or skins fastened with pegs to prevent dirt from sloughing off
and rolling onto the floor. A few shelves might also be provided
by laying wooden slabs on sticks driven into the dirt walls.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">
<img src="images/p15.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="562" />
<p class="pcap">Atsugewi bark house</p>
</div>
<p>There were other less substantial winter houses consisting
either of small double lean-tos of bark slabs or conical houses on
frameworks of slender poles and with shallow excavations. Some
dirt was thrown against the outside walls for added warmth. Lazy
people, who were usually consequently poor in the necessities and
comforts of normal Indian life, lived in this more flimsy type of
house. Also, women when indisposed repaired to such huts. A
doorway was left in the siding to be closed by a tule mat in these
little houses. They were also equipped with small smoke holes
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
for central fires.</p>
<p>Atsugewi summer houses as such really did not exist. Summer
camps were little more than circular enclosures of brush, juniper,
or other conifer limbs or of rock. These were ten or fifteen feet
across with openings to the east. There was no roof, although
branches and bark slabs might be put over crude frames in rainy
weather. If a person were caught in a sudden shower he might make
a temporary shelter by leaning bark slabs, if available, against a
large rock or log lying on the ground.</p>
<p>Atsugewi did not have any separate sweat houses nor dancing
or assembly chambers, but used the larger earth lodge houses for
these purposes. The largest belonged to chiefs and to other well-to-do
Indians. Heat for sweating was provided directly by fire and
not by production of steam as was the case with Plains Indians
who threw water on hot stones. In recent years, however, after
introduction of the horse, Atsugewi learned the latter technique and
also constructed Plains Indian type sweat houses of one to three
person capacity. These were dome shaped, and built of willow
poles set in the ground in a circle. The tops were bent over and
tied down, and this framework was covered with skins.</p>
<p>Old type sweating was for men only, but Indian women&mdash;usually
wives&mdash;also sweated with men in the new style separate sweat
houses. Old time Atsugewi purposes in sweating were for gaining
success in hunting, in gambling, and for general good luck. Some
praying was done, but there were no formalized ceremonies or
dances amongst the Atsugewi. Men sometimes slept in sweat
houses.</p>
<p>In the case of all local tribes sweating was followed by a cold
plunge, if available nearby. Lacking this facility, a cold sponge
bath was taken.</p>
<p>The mountain Maidu earth lodge for dwelling and sweating was
similar to that of the Atsugewi. However, northeast Maidu earth
lodges &ldquo;koom&rdquo; were simpler and smaller than those of northwest
and southern Maidu. Three posts, often forked were used in place
of 10 or 11 employed for valley lodges. Excavation was about
three feet deep, circular in plan, and from 18 to 40 feet across.
A large flat stone was placed upright at the foot of the mainpost
between it and the fire in the center. The vertical walls of the
excavation were usually covered or lined with vertically placed
whole or split logs or with bark slabs. Logs were lain horizontally
on the three posts as indicated on the accompanying sketch. Radial
rafters supporting the roof were placed on these beams and sloping
downward to the ground surface outside as well as to two small
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
posts at the small openway or ventilator passage. Cross poles
were placed horizontally on the rafters and on these, large pieces
of bark, branches, and pine needles were successively laid. Lastly,
a heavy covering of soil 8 to 20 inches thick was heaped on the
structure. On top in the center a smokehole was left, large enough
to serve as the main entrance originally, but after the coming of
white man, the smokehole was made smaller, and, instead, the
originally small ventilator tunnel which sloped from floor level up
to the ground surface outside was enlarged, thus supplanting the
smokehole as the main entrance. Originally a ladder of two poles
with cross pieces tied on with grapevine or other withes gave
vertical access from the floor to the smokehole entrance. Dixon
reports that a notched log was sometimes used for the purpose
among mountain Maidu.</p>
<p>The koom or lodge was occupied from November to March and
was situated on the edges of wide meadows in mountain Maidu
areas. At lower elevation occupancy was more or less continuous.</p>
<p>Mountain Maidu did not have separate sweat houses. They always
used a large earth dwelling lodge for the purpose. This was
similar to the Atsugewi practice. These Maidu did, however, have
a formalized sweat dance. Also different from the Atsugewi was the
practice of men using the sweat house for gambling, handicraft
work, and competitive singing.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;hoe-bow&rdquo; of the mountain Maidu was a hut, 8 to 15 feet
in diameter and excavated 12 to 15 inches deep. Two main poles
were securely tied near the end. From the resulting &ldquo;V&rdquo; at the
top, shorter poles were laid to a pair of slender posts about three
feet high and set about three feet apart along the edge of the excavation.
Against this frame branches, bark, and leaves were piled
and earth was heaped around the bottom. The doors of all such
bark huts opened to the south and were hung with a skin or tule
mat.</p>
<p>The rude summer shelter or shade provider was just like that of
the Atsugewi.</p>
<p>Information on Yahi house details are somewhat scanty, but in
all probability they were small conical bark-covered huts while
some larger earth lodges were built to house several families&mdash;in
general similar, but perhaps smaller than those of the other tribes
of the Lassen area. The large pretentious lodge, constructed
solely for sweating and ceremonies, of the Sacramento Valley tribes
seems to have been lacking among all of our local tribes.</p>
<p>The common bark hut dwelling of the Yana was apparently built
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
over a circular depression two feet deep, the top of the house rising
about six feet above the ground. It was probably like the mountain
Maidu huts, being a series of poles resting on the edges of the excavation.
These met and were tied at the top to form a cone of low
slope, although some informants claimed that the posts were set
so firmly that tying together was omitted. The frames were covered
with pine and incense-cedar bark slabs leaving a smoke hole near
each apex. Earth was probably banked on the lower sloping walls.
Entrance was never through the smoke hole as in the case of
Atsugewi and some mountain Maidu earth lodge houses, but by
means of a small door at ground level on the south side. The entrance
was protected by a little covered way extending outward
three feet from the house wall, and decked over by a gable roof of
low pitch. A ramp of low pitch extended from the floor of the house
through this antechamber to the ground level outside as no steps
were constructed.</p>
<p>The Yana lodge houses were not numerous. The ground plan
was long, usually wedge or oval in outline and designed for several
families, each with its own fire. As with the other tribes discussed
in this booklet, such buildings also served as sweat houses. A
ladder consisting of a notched log extended down from the smoke
hole to the floor. One, two, or three center posts with radiating
rafters and shorter side posts were employed. The Yana followed
the Atsugewi practice of providing each earth lodge with a south
facing, ground level, tunnel-like ventilator entrance of small size.
It is possible that Yana did have a few special sweating lodges
of the same design, but the matter is debatable. During sweating
Yana men talked and played; the main purpose of sweating was to
make men strong.</p>
<p>It has already been pointed out that all four tribes which used
what is now Lassen Volcanic National Park did so only during the
summer. During their high mountain sojourn, the local Indians did
not live in houses as such. There, residence during the three or
four summer months was in temporary camps, usually roofless
circular areas to accommodate several families. These were fenced
in with brush and were entered by one or more openings somewhat
in the same manner as campsites reserved for visitors at their
permanent villages at lower elevations. Four-posted horizontal
roofs, to provide shade, were sometimes constructed too. Yana
seem to have made a lean-to or hut with grass and bark covering
for summer roofs.</p>

<br />HOUSEHOLD TOOLS, IMPLEMENTS, AND WEAPONS</h2>
<p>Implements for grinding foods were important. Mountain Maidu,
in fact all Maidu tribes, ground some acorns on flat bed rock. When
the resultant holes which eventually developed in the rock surfaces
became deep, they were abandoned as the acorn meal tended to
pack into hard lumps at the bottoms thereof. A heavy flat stone
grinding slab was most frequently used. However, all Lassen area
tribes had portable stone mortar bowls too. The Atsugewi and
mountain Maidu did not make these nor did they use them for grinding
food. Such portable stone mortars were found, evidently having
been fashioned by more ancient tribes. Supernatural powers were
ascribed to these mortars, and they were used only by shamans or
medicine men. The Maidu thought that stone mortar bowls were
made by Coyote at the time of creation and scattered over the world
for the use of mankind. Others believed the mortars to have been
&ldquo;first people&rdquo; originally, who were turned to stones in this form
upon the coming of the Indian people at which time other &ldquo;first
people&rdquo; were transformed into animals.</p>

<p>As has been described under the preparation of acorn mush,
local tribes used the flat stone pounding slab under an open
bottomed hopper basket, most commonly. The hopper basket of
the Atsugewi and mountain Maidu was usually of twined construction
and bound often with buckskin about the basal edge. Mountain
Maidu sometimes employed their coiling technique in making the
acorn pounding basket. It was from this tribe, at the turn of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
century, that Atsugewi learned to make their pounding hopper
baskets of the stronger coiled construction.</p>

<p class="pcap">One of several seed

</div>
<p>Pestles of stone were long, smoothed, and sometimes flattened
on the sides. This resulted from use of these implements also as
rubbing or mulling stones for processing small seeds on flat slabs
without employment of basket hoppers. The pestles were always
without the ornamentation used by certain other California tribes.
The pounding end of the food grinding pestles are ever so slightly
convex&mdash;their grinding surfaces are nearly flat. This is in contrast
to pestles used in the deep bowl-shaped portable stone
mortars for ceremonial purposes. The grinding ends of these pestles
were strongly rounded, nearly hemispherical in shape.</p>
<p>The muller or small seed crusher used on the flat grinding slab
without a hopper basket was of oval or rectangular shape, and it
too was unornamented.</p>
<p>Small brushes used in miscellaneous food preparation were made
of pounded dried soap-plant bulb fibers.</p>
<p>Hot rocks for cooking were usually handled with two sticks.
None of our tribes used spoons. Crude obsidian knives with, or
more commonly without, bone handles were used for many chores.</p>
<p>Yana used split cobble stones for cutting and scraping operations.
Their stone knives sometimes had wrapped buckskin handles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Bone awls, usually with wrapped handles, were commonly used
for sewing buckskin and other hides. Atsugewi are said by some to
have had both eyed and open notched needles of bone for sewing
skins and tule mats.</p>
<p>The wooden shuttle for net weaving was a stick notched at both
ends and was used by all of the local tribes. A squarish wooden
net mesh spacer permitted nets to be properly made.</p>
<p>Mountain Maidu used deer antler wedges for splitting wood while
Atsugewi used wooden wedges&mdash;especially of mountain-mahogany.
Wedges were usually driven with simple wooden clubs, though rocks
might be employed for the purpose.</p>
<p>Drills for boring holes in shell work and for making pipes and
the like were used by Atsugewi only. Such drills were wooden
shafts with stone points. These were rotated by rolling the shaft
between the palms of the hands. Where the drill was not in use,
holes were made in pieces of wood with live coals. Sometimes
unfinished clamshell money was received in trade perhaps at a discount.
Such pieces were strung tightly onto a cord and the whole
string was then rolled between two flat stones thus grinding the
shell edges to make the well formed disks characteristic of clam
shell money.</p>

<p>Fire making drills were of greater importance. All local tribes

<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
affairs which did not utilize the labor saving drill bow of the midwest.
A long buckeye wood stick about half an inch thick was
twirled on a notched block of incense-cedar or juniper wood. A
bed of dry shredded grass and incense-cedar or other flammable
tinder was used to nourish the spark into flame. Both sexes made
fire among the Yana and Yahi, but unless the men were away,
Atsugewi and mountain Maidu women did not make fire. Buckeye
was uncommon or lacking in the areas of the latter tribes, so this
material had to be traded from the Yana and Yahi. Buckeye fire
making sticks commanded quite a price, a piece two feet long often
selling for ten completed arrows. Since fire making required much
effort and skill, fire was rarely allowed to go out. A &ldquo;slow match&rdquo;
consisting of a piece of punky wood in which the fire smouldered
was usually carried along.</p>

<p>It was as true in prehistoric America as it is today that weapons
were essential to existence. Weapons were necessary not only for
warfare&mdash;whether aggressive or defensive&mdash;but for the securing
of game for food since domestication of animals was not practiced.</p>
<p>The bow and arrow was the only important weapon of California
Indians. Local bows were rather short and quite broad in cross-section.
We quote Garth&rsquo;s &ldquo;Atsugewi Ethnography&rdquo; on the subject
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;... The best bows were made by the Atsuge, who had
a supply of yew wood ... along the western borders of their
territory. The Paiute were anxious to trade for Atsuge bows
and considered them much superior to their own. In making the
bow a piece of yew wood was selected, split, and shaved down
with flints and pumice stone to the required form and thickness.
After it had been wrapped in green grass and roasted in
hot ashes, the bow was bent to required shape (recurved tips
with a slight incurve at the middle), which it retained when
it cooled off. Sinew, taken from the back of a deer, was
softened by chewing and was then glued on the back of the
bow in short strips, which were rubbed out as flat as possible
with a smooth piece of bone. Salmon skins were boiled to
make the glue.</p>

<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
bows are among the few examples of masculine art. The painting
was done with a feather tip. The sinew for the bowstring
... was chewed to make it soft and then it was made into a
two-ply cord by rolling it with the open hand on the thigh.
After salmon glue was rubbed in to make the fibers stick together,
the string was stretched by tying a rock to one end and
allowing it to hang down from some support. A tassel ... of
mole skin might be attached to the end of the bow for decoration....</p>

<p>&ldquo;... Flint tipped arrows ... were made of cane or rose
and had foreshafts of Serviceberry, or they might be entirely of
Service wood. Cane arrows ... with a sharp-pointed foreshaft
of Serviceberry were commonly used for small animals
and birds. Such arrows might be unfeathered ... (an informant)
recalled a bird arrow ... with a barbed wooden point.
Deer-bone pointed arrows were sometimes used for killing
deer and other game. Voegelin reports that these arrows were
also sometimes barbed. Flint-tipped arrows were about thirty
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
inches long ... arrows for small game were somewhat shorter
than flint-tipped arrows ... the wood was ordinarily dried
before it was used. The end of the Serviceberry foreshaft was
cut into a dowel which was inserted in the soft pithy center of
the main shaft, the juncture being wrapped with sinew. A
notch one-fourth of an inch deep was cut in the butt. A
laterally notched obsidian arrow point was inserted in the split
end of the foreshaft and bound on with cross lashings of
sinew. The binding was ordinarily waterproofed with pitch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two small grooved pumice stones were used to smooth
arrow shafts. The foreshaft was painted red as an indication
that poison had been applied to the point. Other bands or
stripes of color toward the nock end of the arrow served as
ownership marks ... the stripes might run spirally as on a
stick of candy ... all kinds of colors being used for painting
arrows. Feathers were split along the midrib and were glued
to the shaft, about a finger&rsquo;s width below the butt, with pitch.
Sinew wrapping bound down each end of the feathers, three of
which&mdash;about four inches long&mdash;were used to an arrow. The
edge of the feather was burned smooth with a hot coal.
Feathers of hawks or similar birds were used on ordinary
arrows, but for the finest arrows&mdash;those to be used for bear
and deer&mdash;eagle feathers were employed. An arrow wrench
of bone or wood was used for straightening arrows; or they
might simply be straightened by using the teeth as a vise. A
flat antelope horn might be perforated and used as an arrow
wrench.... (John La Mar) had a small triangular stone with
a hole in the center ... which, he said was heated in the
fire and used for straightening cane arrows.</p>

<p>Arrow points found in the park area, in the territory of both
Atsugewi and mountain Maidu are most frequently of obsidian, but
sometimes are of a dense dull black basalt lava. The term flint
is a very loose one, being applied to obsidian, chert, opal, chalcedony,
and even to the dense basalt, noted above, in common usage.</p>
<p>Mountain Maidu imported yew wood as this did not commonly
grow in their own territory. This tribe, however, also manufactured
its own bows. In practically all respects bow and arrow design and
execution were identical to that of the Atsugewi. Those of Yana
and Yahi were similar too. All tribes of the Lassen area fashioned
arrow points with barbs. In addition mountain Maidu flaked points
without barbs but with basal stems for attachment were made.</p>

<p>The bow was most frequently held in shooting at an angle of
about 45 degrees with the arrow on top. Mountain Maidu used that
style, too, or else held the bow horizontally with the arrow on top
except in case of war when the arrow was held on the underside of
the bow. Gifford and Klimak reveal that northern and central Yana
held the bow horizontally. Sapir and Spier found that the Yana
tribes proper (not Yahi), however held bows vertically in shooting.
All tribes considered except Yahi used the primary release of the
arrow in shooting. In this method the arrow was held between the
index and third fingers, which caught and pulled back the string.
The thumb held the other side of the arrow. The Yahi, on the other
hand used the Mongolian release; grasping the arrow with the thumb
and unbent first joints of the first and second fingers.</p>

<p>War clubs were not used. Atsugewi claim to have had a stone
axe, sharpened by chipping and lashed with sinew to a split oak

chopping roots and small trees on occasion, but the stone axe was
certainly not widely used by California Indians, and even among
Atsugewi it may have been unknown until the coming of white man,
or knowledge of it may have been gained from Plains Indians after
the advent of the horse. The tomahawk, so important to Indians of
eastern and midwestern North America, was unknown to California
Indians. Trees were normally felled and cut by controlled burning.</p>
<p>Four-foot spears, tipped with large flaked stone points for fighting
at close quarters, were used by all local tribes on occasion,
but were not numerous. Only the Yana are believed to have thrown
the weapon; the more common usage seems to have been by energetically
thrusting it.</p>
<p>Knives or daggers as fighting implements were made of chipped
obsidian but were quite rare. A short, crude, one edged, stone
knife was used widely as a general utility implement, but not in
combat nor in killing game. Yana Indians also employed a mussel
shell knife for light delicate work around camp. Atsugewi and
mountain Maidu sometimes affixed wooden handles to their obsidian
knives. These two tribes also fashioned knives of sharpened bone
and horn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Defensive armor included rod armor ..., gowns ...
of dried elk or bear skins, and skin helmets which came down
over the forehead and ears, &lsquo;so a man could just see out of it&rsquo;.
The skin armor extended to the ankles or lower; it was worn
over one shoulder so that it protected only the side of the body
turned toward the enemy. Rod armor, made of serviceberry
withes twined together with buckskin string, was high enough
to come up to the neck under the chin and extended two or
three inches below the belt. The Plains Indian shield, although
found among the Surprise Valley Paiute and other Paiute tribes
to the east, was lacking among the Atsugewi,&rdquo; and all other
tribes of the Lassen area.</p>

<br />BASKETRY AND TEXTILES</h2>
<p>The outstanding art of the Indians of California was their
basketry. In fact the excellence of California basketry generally
is not exceeded elsewhere in North America. Size varies from that
of a pea to that of a bushel basket. Both weave and ornamentation
were very diversified.</p>
<p>Basketry of the Lassen area, especially that of the Atsugewi
and mountain Maidu, was of good quality. Both coiled and twined
types of basketry (to be described below) were made by mountain
Maidu, but the Atsugewi did not learn the art of coiled basketry
from the Maidu until the early 1900&rsquo;s. Yana and Yahi wove both
types but twined baskets were by far the more numerous. This is
due to the fact that these tribes were akin to the twining tribes of
the north. Close contact with the neighboring Wintun tribes of the
Sacramento Valley resulted in the addition of limited amount of
coiling technique in their basketry making over the years.</p>

</div>
<p>Coiled basketry itself had some technical variations with which
we shall not concern ourselves. The coiling technique was characteristic
of the central and southern part of the California area.
Mountain Maidu used three willow rods in a parallel group which
ran as a core in a continuous spiral starting at the center of the
basket. This was the warp element. The bundle of three willow
ribs was lashed to the preceding basketry by a strand or weft (filler)
of the inner bark of redbud. This was accomplished by poking an
awl through the preceding row, and separating the stitches. In
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
doing so, the awl was passed under the topmost of the core or warp
of three coiling willow ribs. A redbud bark strand was then slipped
through the awl hole, thus lashing the three loose willow ribs down
by passing the strand around them and through the next awl hole in
the preceding row. Recent Atsugewi coiled basketry technique is
similar in all details, having been learned from the Maidu.</p>

starting the round root-cleaning basket; b, detail of side wall of
basket showing open work weave. (Garth)</p>
</div>
<p>Twined basketry consisted of willow ribs radiating from a
common center. These twigs were the warp. The weft of filling
and binding stitches were split pine root strands. Dixon states
that mountain Maidu sometimes dyed pine root black by burying it
in mud mixed with charcoal. Pine root was tightly woven in to make
the bottom of the basket which was normally undecorated. More
and more willow ribs were added as the basket became larger. The
willow ribs were curved up when willow rib additions were decreased.
As the sides began to be built up on these twined baskets,
each pine root stitch, both inside and outside, was covered with a
whitish strand of bear-grass or squaw-grass. The tops of baskets
were often left unfinished after the unused willow warps were
clipped off. The basket did not unravel in use. However, the best
baskets were finished by adding a marginal strengthening ring of
choke cherry or willow which was bound to the basket body firmly
and neatly, usually by wrapping with strands of redbud bark. During
weaving willow withes were fastened inside of the basket to help
it retain its shape, but these were removed upon completion of the
basket.</p>

<p>Some utility baskets were undecorated, being made merely of
pine root and willow, or, if coiled, of redbud and willow. However,
most baskets bore some designs. They were all named and were
inspired by the objects of nature about these outdoor peoples, and
not the product of their imaginations. Nevertheless, the designs
are quite stylized, often to the extent that recognition of the inspiration
is difficult or impossible.</p>
<p>In the case of twined baskets the designs were made by substituting
outer redbud bark for squaw-grass to produce a dull red
instead of the white overlaid stitches of the rest of the basket.
As a result of the double twining technique the designs were seen
equally well on the inside and the outside of each basket. Black
designs were of overlaid maidenhair fern (<i>Adiantum pedatum</i>) stems.
However, mountain Maidu also used common bracken fern (<i>Pteris
aquilinum</i>) for black designs. Indians to the north of the Atsugewi
used roots and stems of certain sedges treated with charcoal and
mud or with ashes and water to produce basketry materials of black
and of warm henna-brown coloration respectively. These were
used on occasion by Atsugewi. The bear-grass, redbud, and maidenhair
fern decorative materials were most commonly used by all
tribes of this area. Atsugewi are the only local Indians to have
used feathers to adorn their baskets. They used the shiny iridescent
blue-green feathers from the necks of male mallard ducks. This
was not common, however, and by no means used as often nor
developed to the fine art and diversity of the famous Pomo feathered
basketry of the Clear Lake region of the California Coast Range.
Atsugewi are also believed to have occasionally adorned some
basketry work with shell beads and porcupine quills, but this must
have been quite rare or more examples would have survived to the
present day.</p>
<p>Outer bark of redbud almost always decorated coiled baskets.</p>
<p>Concerning Maidu basketry Dixon states that the vast majority
of the articles are of the coiled type, twining technique being used
only for burden baskets and hopper or grinding baskets. For the
radial ribs of the former they used shoots of hazel (<i>Corylus
rostrata</i> var. <i>californica</i>) when available. He points out too, the
frequent use of the feather, quail-tip, and arrow-point designs not
only among the mountain Maidu, but among all Maidu. A characteristic
of this group of Indians also, in contrast to other local
tribes, is the tendency to confine one design to a basket rather than
combining designs. Maidu employed a wide variety of designs.
Many of them represent animals and plants. A considerable number
of Maidu patterns exhibit a more or less obscure realism which
becomes apparent only after one is informed as to what the design
means. The Maidu show a tendency also toward arrangement of
design elements in spiral or zigzag lines.</p>

<p>Dixon noted that &ldquo;mussel&rsquo;s tongue&rdquo; (the fresh water mussel)
is one of the unique and peculiar basketry designs used by the
Atsugewi. Representation of intestines and deer excrement are also
worthy of special mention for this tribe. Other common Atsugewi
designs in basketry decoration are lizard, deer rib, owl&rsquo;s claw, and
flying geese, as well as arrow-point. Two or more different designs
are often combined on a single basket. Among Atsugewi and
Achomawi there seems to be no restriction of certain patterns to
baskets intended for special uses. Like mountain Maidu, zigzag
and spiral arrangements are preferred, horizontal bands being rare.
Curiously an Atsugewi design is often given different meaning by
different individual Indians. This is in contrast to the uniformity
of interpretation of a given design by all the Maidu individuals,
normally.</p>

<p>Yana tribes frequently substituted another material for willow
ribs. The identity of this warp is not certain. Reliable students
believe it to be hazelnut twigs, but to my knowledge that plant is
scarce indeed even in the foothill territory. Yana and Yahi had
some other peculiarities in their basketry. Designs were sometimes
wrought in a negative way, that is by merely leaving off
overlay so that the design was thereby defined in exposed pine
root weft. Sapir and Spier found that these tribes also used alder
bark for dying basketry decoration materials a red-brown. A reddish
color was produced on peeled shield fern stems by passing them
through the mouth while chewing dogwood bark. They dyed pine
roots, too, on occasion with a red soil or with the powdery filling
of spores from the inside of a fungus obtained from certain coniferous
trees. These variations of basketry decoration do not seem to
have been used by the Atsugewi and mountain Maidu.</p>

<p>The basketry described above was all close-woven. In fact,
so closely were the twined baskets made that they held water with
little or no leakage even without linings of pitch or any other substance.
There was no pottery of any kind in central or northern
California.</p>
<p>The art of basketry included also a third type&mdash;loose or open
weaving, sometimes of tules. The latter were also used extensively
for making mats for a variety of purposes. Open weaving at other
times was done with willow withes, split juniper twigs, or of
another material tentatively identified as hazel. Fish traps, carrying
baskets, some storage baskets, and bags were not infrequently
of this type of construction.</p>
<p>All basketry materials had to be well soaked in water, as they
were brittle when dry. After weaving and upon drying these materials
set in place, making the basketry firm, strong, and resistant
to unraveling.</p>
<p>Collection of basketry materials was more arduous and required
greater know-how than might be suspected. Willow withes were
only taken from the particularly strong and supple shoots from Hinds
or valley willow (<i>Salix hindsiana</i>) which grows along stream banks
up to 3000 foot elevations and also from the similar sandbar, river,
or grey willow (<i>Salix fluviatilis</i> variety <i>argyrophylla</i>) which also
lines streams, often growing in sandbars. These species are
recognized by their long very narrow silvery leaves and a grey bark,
furrowed when mature. Willow twigs were collected when the leaves
were off of the stems in the spring and in the fall. At other times
the twigs were more brittle. Spring picked willow withes &ldquo;slipped&rdquo;
their bark easily, but those collected in the fall had to be scraped
to remove the bark. The willow ribs were further dressed by scraping
to uniform size.</p>
<p>Pine roots of either ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>) or digger
pine (<i>Pinus sabiniana</i>) were usually used. However not all trees
had roots of suitable strength and flexibility, so that it was necessary
to &ldquo;shop around&rdquo; for good roots. This involved digging holes
to reach the roots and then testing these by tugging on small
strands until suitable roots were located. Roots three or four inches
in diameter were then cut off with a small obsidian axe, if the individual
were so fortunate as to possess this rarity, or by using a sort
of bone pick, or, more commonly, by slowly burning through the green
root with a small fire. Root lengths of about four feet were gathered,
taken home, and there roasted in hot ashes. This made the pine
roots very soft. They were then split into quarters with digging
sticks or stone choppers and finally were pulled apart into thin
strips using hands and teeth. The resulting half inch wide strips
were tied into bundles for storage. In use, these strips were well
soaked in water. Pine root strands of proper width were easily
split off by hand. The finer and smaller the basketry to be done,
naturally, the narrower was the material split for making it.</p>

<p>The chief overlay material&mdash;already mentioned&mdash;was what
we call bear-grass or squaw-grass. In truth this is not grass, but
the leaf of a lily, the well known bear-grass of Mount Rainier
National Park, scientifically known as <i>Xerophylum tenax</i>. This
grows only in limited areas in this region, hence Atsugewi had to
make long trips on foot to obtain it. In recent years, at least, bear-grass
was to be found only in the territory of the Shasta and of the
mountain Maidu: a few miles west of Mount Shasta and near Greenville
in Plumas County. Bear-grass could be collected only during
about two weeks in mid-July. Earlier it was too tender; later it
was too brittle &ldquo;like hay&rdquo;. Only new central leaves of each plant
were plucked. The heavy mid-rib had to be removed from each
leaf with an awl before use.</p>
<p>Maidenhair fern frond stems were picked in August.</p>
<p>Redbud twigs collected in the spring would &ldquo;slip&rdquo; the red outer
bark easily in a thin layer. This was used for overlay pattern
making on twined baskets. The white inner bark, or, more properly,
sapwood was then stripped off for binding material and as the white
lashing weft for coiled baskets. In the case of fall-collected redbud
twigs the red outer bark adhered to the sapwood. This was
used as the lashing strand or weft where red designs were desired
on coiled baskets.</p>
<p>Apwaruge, the eastern division of the Atsugewi, often made
baskets of tules. These were more flexible, softer baskets than
those made by the westerners, the Atsuge, and so there was considerable
exchange of baskets between the two divisions of the
Atsugewi.</p>
<p>Atsugewi occasionally made openwork baskets from split juniper
too, especially for low scoop-shaped, round, or oval baskets for
fishing, root cleaning, et cetera, but as indicated earlier, willow
ribs were used for this purpose also.</p>

<p>Basket styles varied little among the several tribes of the
Lassen region. Bottle shapes were never made until after the
coming of white man. Cooking baskets were bowl-shaped with
high, convexly curved sides, sometimes nearly globular in form.
Baskets from which food was eaten individually and general utility
baskets were similarly shaped but smaller. Boiling baskets were
sometimes without decoration; their dimensions of height and width
were about equal. Storage baskets also had about the same shape,
curving less, sometimes, but were large, being three feet or more
in size. Some were of open work, but usually they were of close
or tight weaving.</p>
<p>Flattish bowls or somewhat curved trays were used for food
platters as well as for winnowing, parching, and cleaning foods by
chafing. Some were of open weave made of willow or hazel (?) only
while others were closely woven.</p>
<p>Basketry acorn grinding hoppers also called milling baskets or
pounding baskets, were usually regular twined baskets of suitable
size and shape: wide mouthed bowl or funnel-shaped. Having no
central point from which to start the warp, because of the open
bottoms, hopper baskets were started by twining three pine root
wefts about the bases of many willow warps to make a circle about
five inches in diameter. Additional warps were built up on the
radiating ribs, proceeding then in the normal manner of twining.
Twined hopper baskets were usually reinforced by lashing one or
two strong rings of willow or serviceberry withes. They might also
be bound with buckskin along the bottom edges for improved
strength and durability as well as to decrease loss of acorn meal
during the pounding process. In recent years both mountain Maidu
and Atsugewi, also used coiling technique in making hopper
baskets, for which purpose it is well suited.</p>
<p>A recent innovation among Atsugewi has been the covering of
bottles with basketry and also the weaving of oblong shaped closely
twined and coiled baskets, as well as goblet shaped creations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Garth, the seed beater &ldquo;... was a paddle-shaped
implement from one and a half to two feet long with a
willow warp and open work twining, also of willow (spaced at
three quarters of an inch between rows) across the blade. The
handle was wrapped either with willow strips or with
buckskin.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another important use of basketry was in the construction of
cradle boards, or more properly, basket cradles. These are generally
known to present day Americans by the incorrect term papoose
baskets. The cradle basket is discussed under the heading &ldquo;Birth
and Babies&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Beautifully made basketry caps for women, finely twined, spreading
bowl-shaped affairs were made by all tribes of the Lassen
area. These were nicely decorated on the bottoms&mdash;or rather
tops&mdash;as well as on the sides, a feature lacking on all other types
of local baskets. Another unique feature of the basketry cap was
the fact that the inside of the hat was abraded by rubbing so that
none of the pattern remained visible because all of the overlay on
the inside had been worn away. It is suspected that this made the
inside of the hat less slippery on the hair so that it did not slip
off the head so easily. Removal of the decoration from the inside
of the basketry cap in no way altered the appearance or permanence
of the outside decorative patterns.</p>
<p>Mats were woven of viscid bulrush, more commonly called tule
stalks (<i>Scirpus lacustris</i> or <i>acutus</i>). According to Voegelin,
Atsugewi sometimes sewed these together by piercing them with
bone needles. However the more usual method of manufacture was
that of lashing together the ends of parallel tule stalks laid next
to each other. This was done with double cords or strands in the
regular simple twining manner which shows up well in the sketch
of Atsugewi tule leggings. Such mats were extensively used as
bed mats or mattresses, as earth wall coverings, as doorway and
ventilator hole hangings, and so on by all of the tribes of the
Lassen region. Mountain Maidu also employed broad-leaved cat-tail
(<i>Typha latifolia</i>) or narrow-leaved cat-tail (<i>Typha angustifolia</i>)
for such purposes on occasion. This tribe also appears to have
used a string weft in making at least some of the mats.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">Chapter XII</span>
<br />TANNING, CORDAGE, AND GLUE</h2>
<p>Mountain Maidu buried bear skins in wet ground, but hides
generally were soaked about a week in water by local Indians.
Mountain Maidu used ashes to help dehair skins other than deer,
but this was not a practice common to other tribes. Stone, or more
frequently, shaped deer rib or pelvic bones were used as dehairing
scraper tools on skins. The hide was draped over an inclined post
and was soaked and squeezed occasionally during the process of
scraping.</p>
<p>The tanning agent was a cooked soup of animal brains, particularly
those of deer. This material might first have been mashed,
mixed with dry moss, and then molded into small cakes for drying
and storage. The deer brain agent was well rubbed into the cleaned,
soaked skin. It was then allowed to soak overnight in the tanning
solution. The next day while drying the skin in the sun, the operator
stretched and worked the hide with his hands to make it soft
and pliable.</p>
<p>Among Atsugewi the skin was then smoked over a fire of moist
rotten logs or green juniper boughs burning in a shallow pit. The
skin was laid on a domed framework of willow branches arched
over the fire. The hide was turned occasionally to insure uniform
treatment. Mr. Garth believes that this smoking process was recently
learned. It was not generally practiced by neighboring tribes,
but produced superior buckskin which resisted stiffening as a result
of subsequent wetting. Even Atsugewi did not smoke other skins.</p>

<p class="pcap">Nets. a, b, stages in net making; c, tule float; d, net shuttle.</p>
</div>
<p>Men did all this work as well as the hunting, skinning, and
fashioning of garments from hides. Skins were sewn with bone
awls and deer sinew thread which was made by rolling fine deer
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>

</div>
<p>Like other local tribes, the Maidu used many woven skin
blankets. These were fashioned from one inch strips of rabbit fur,
especially, but also of the skins of wildcat, cougar, geese, or crows.
These were not tanned so that upon drying they twisted or curled
like the strands of a rope with the fur or feather side out. Ends
were tied together to form a long fur or feather covered rope. This
was wound about two poles set upright in the ground six feet or so
apart to form the warp for the blanket. More of the same material
was then woven up and down as weft to produce a soft and very
warm skin blanket which was also quite durable. When bird skins
were employed a cord core was threaded thru the center of the
twisted strands before weaving for greater strength.</p>
<p>Mountain Maidu also did feather work like that of the Atsugewi,
however foothill and valley Maidu did so to a greater extent and
of a more elaborate nature.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>Willow, serviceberry, and redbud withes, and at lower elevations,
lengths of wild grape vines were used for tying purposes.
However, Indians also had need for strong and more versatile and
more durable string, cord, and rope. These were usually made from
vegetable fibers. Atsugewi and mountain Maidu used Indian hemp
and milkweed but not nettle or iris fibers as did some other tribes.
When mature, but before they became old and brittle, the plants
were collected and dried, stripped of leaves, and the flesh was
scraped and pounded off leaving the free fibers. String was made
by placing two small bundles of fibers parallel and close together
on the thigh of the leg. These were rolled up into two strands side
by side with one stroke of the open hand moving either up or down
the thigh. On the return stroke the two separate and now twisted
strands were twisted together into one string. Stout cord was made
by repeating the process, substituting two strings for the two
bundles of loose fibers this time. To make rope the process
was repeated several times, successively doubling the cordage
product. As the cordage strands were twined together, the product
was held in the left hand, the rolling being done by the right hand
on the right thigh.</p>
<p>Nets of good quality were fabricated in a variety of mesh sizes,
the uniformity of which was controlled by use of squarish wooden
blocks. Shuttles to hold the string for net tying were straight pieces
of wood notched at each end and into which the strand was wrapped.
As has been pointed out, nets were used chiefly for hunting, fishing,
and carrying, although small nets were often worn in the hair
by men.</p>
<p>Adhesives were important in the economy of the Indians too.
Pine pitch and glue made from the skins of fish were used. A
solution of the latter was mixed by the mountain Maidu with certain
internal organs of fish and boiled vegetable materials to improve
the quality of their glue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">Chapter XIII</span>
<br />TRANSPORTATION</h2>
<p>It was the lack of transportation rather than the existence of any
which was important to the aboriginal Americans. This was responsible
for the degree of isolation which was required to produce
the variety of customs and languages in most parts of the &ldquo;New
World&rdquo;. Introduction of the horse in historic times materially
changed the habits of Plains Indians. Likewise the somewhat
aggressive Modoc tribe to the north of the Pit River, whose conflict
with the whites has been memorialized in Lava Beds National
Monument today, became mobile, even prior to the gold rush days,
through use of the horse. As a result the Modocs made a number of
hit and run raids upon Atsugewi and other tribes and were able to
carry off slaves. This was not the traditional mode of warfare.</p>
<p>Transportation among Indians was by foot or by water until recent
times. California Indians did not use dogs as beasts of burden as
Plains Indians did and as the Eskimos still do. Women did general
hauling; men, however, did most of the really heavy carrying.
Women used the conical burden basket extensively, but the men did
not. Both sexes used the buckskin pack strap which in the case
of mountain Maidu passed over the top of the head. Atsugewi pack
straps went over the forehead and also over the shoulder across
the chest. The brimless basketry cap or hat was used with the
packstrap especially among the women. Heavy loads were frequently
carried by men upon the shoulder; such burdens were often rolled
in mats or animal skins.</p>
<p>Carrying nets made of twisted fibers were commonly employed
by men and women among local tribes. Atsugewi used a folded
buckskin bag sewed at the edges, with a handle on top, and opening
at the side. Yana manufactured an open-work carrying basket too.</p>
<p>In this region loads were never carried on the head, but on
occasion might be suspended on a pole and carried between two
men. The mountain Maidu also used a litter for the sick, but
Atsugewi carried sick persons in burden baskets on their backs.</p>
<p>In rough country crude trails were sometimes built, but this was
not a common practice. Generally trails as such were not constructed,
but where they existed they had developed as the result of long
use along logical routes, in much the same manner as deer and other
game trails develop.</p>
<p>To cross streams advantage was taken of logs which had fallen
of natural causes. On occasion single logs were felled by burning
to serve as bridges. Yana at lower elevations frequently had large
streams to cross and smaller trees to utilize. Two logs might be
felled parallel and cross sticks lashed on with grapevine for better
footing.</p>

</div>
<p>In swimming most Indians used a pseudo-breast stroke or swam
on their backs with a frog style stroke. Atsugewi also did a &ldquo;dog
paddle&rdquo; keeping arms under water. Mountain Maidu used swimming
techniques which embraced principles like those of white man&rsquo;s
side stroke and crawl. They jumped into the water feet first in
preference to headfirst diving. When swimming under water to
collect crawfish or mussels a rock was often tied loosely to the
back.</p>
<p>Water transportation was not of the same degree of importance
to the tribes of the Lassen region that it was to Sacramento Valley,
Coastal, and Northwestern Indians. Nevertheless Atsugewi used
sharp or blunt ended canoes while that of the mountain Maidu had
a shovel-like prow and stern. These were made from pine logs,
usually windfalls about two feet in diameter and had a capacity of
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
two to four persons. The logs were hollowed out by controlled
burning so that the walls were an inch or two thick. Pitch was
rubbed onto portions needing more burning. Water or mud were used
to check burning and the charred wood was scraped out with rough
angular stones. Local dugout canoes were rather crude affairs.
Cracking of the wood was prevented by keeping the boats wet. They
were propelled by an unadorned poling rod or by a single bladed
square-ended paddle about three feet long. A raft, consisting of
three or four logs lashed together, was used as well by all local
tribes and propelled by poling.</p>
<p>Atsugewi had another type of craft: the tule balsa&mdash;a five foot
long raised prow affair made of bundles of tules lashed together.
It might be poled or else pushed by a swimmer. Often this raft-like
boat was towed by a rope of willow. Atsugewi occasionally ferried
children or goods in baskets, while among mountain Maidu swimmers
carried children on their backs and carried goods in one hand,
raised above the water level, swimming with the other hand.</p>

<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">Chapter XIV</span>
<br />DOMESTICATED ANIMALS AND PETS</h2>
<p>We are apt to think of Indians, especially Plains Indians, riding
horses as part of the natural prehistoric scene, yet this was not
the case. Although fossil remains in the rocks show clearly
the development of the horse over a period of several millions
of years on this continent, the horse, the camel, and the rhinoceros&mdash;to
mention but a few of the spectacular mammals&mdash;became
extinct on the American continents before the advent of prehistoric
man. American Indians had never seen a horse until the coming
of the Spanish to the New World in 1540. Likewise domestic cattle,
sheep, goats, and chickens were unknown to the aborigines.</p>
<p>The dog was widely distributed, however. Some tribes had large
as well as small dogs of a variety of colors. In the Lassen area
the dogs were all about the size of small coyotes, mostly with fairly
short hair, but there are some reports of long haired dogs. Typically
the dogs had small rather erect and pointed ears. Coloration was
chiefly fawn colored to brown. Amongst Atsugewi, dogs were
usually quite numerous, but certain villages seem to have had only
a few. In such cases and among the mountain Maidu, who generally
had only few dogs, they were borrowed for hunting. Dogs were
almost always named.</p>
<p>Dogs served to warn their owners of the approach of strangers
to the village or camp. Mountain Maidu taught their dogs not to
bark, but to &ldquo;sniff&rdquo; conspicuously as a signal of stranger approach.</p>
<p>Tribes of the Lassen area did not normally keep dogs in their
dwelling houses. Atsugewi built separate, domed, bark-covered
dog houses, and mountain Maidu built two kinds of shelters for
their dogs. One was a subterranean earth-covered dog house, and
the other a conical affair of bark slab type construction.</p>
<p>Dogs were widely used in hunting. They were efficient in catching
rodents and other small mammals such as ground hogs. They
were also useful for treeing mountain lions and were adept at
bringing down wounded deer by jumping up and seizing the deers&rsquo;
ears.</p>
<p>Dogs were not often eaten by tribes in this section of California.
Upon death, dogs were not buried, but the bodies were merely thrown
out.</p>
<p>Upon death of the dog&rsquo;s owner, among Atsugewi, the dog was
retained by the widow, but among mountain Maidu the dog was suspended
in a tree because &ldquo;It makes dog&rsquo;s spirit glad&rdquo;! Although
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
not being generally considered in this account, it is curious that
among Modoc and eastern Achomawi dogs were burned at the deaths
of their owners.</p>
<p>Bear cubs were commonly kept. Atsugewi also kept fawns and
other small mammals as pets. Birds of various sorts were kept by
certain tribes. Atsugewi plucked or cut wings of birds, especially
of eagles whose feathers were prized for arrow making, and for
ceremonial and decorative purposes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">Chapter XV</span>
<br />CLOTHING</h2>
<p>The members of all tribes, especially the Yana and Yahi, went
bareheaded much of the time. However, basketry caps nearly
hemispherical in shape and of fine tightly twined weave were worn
regularly by Indian women. The caps were probably worn to prevent
chafing of the pack straps originally, but Atsugewi women wore
them most of the time. Such hats were well decorated with overlaid
designs typical of the tribes under consideration. Those of Yana
and Yahi were usually of tule with black and white overlay.
Mountain Maidu made some coiled basketry caps, not infrequently
employing tules or reeds.</p>
<p>Men of all our tribes wore fur headbands on occasion and among
Atsugewi, fur or buckskin caps too, especially in winter, when
shallow bucket shaped skin hats of coyote, raccoon, mink and the
like afforded protection against the rather intense cold.</p>
<p>Eyeshades attached to a band around the head were worn by
some Yana women so as not to see their sons-in-law! Atsugewi
men and possibly others might wear side blinds when spearing fish
at night to keep torch light out of their eyes.</p>
<p>Children up to about six years of age ran about naked, and often
the older men and women did likewise, particularly among the
Maidu.</p>
<p>Buckskin dresses were worn to some extent by the women of
most local tribes. The mountain Maidu dress was tied at both
shoulders and tied or belted at the waist. The garment was provided
with flaps over the upper arms but lacked sleeves. Buckskin
dresses were worn by some Indian women rich in worldly goods,
and usually for special occasions. Recent buckskin dresses, of
course, are sewn on sewing machines, neatly tailored, and follow
the general pattern of the conventional dress, including regular
sleeves.</p>
<p>In normal everyday garb Indian women were naked above the
waist. A wrap-around skirt, or, more frequently two narrow or wide
aprons were worn. Sometimes one apron went around the hips, being
tied in back and provided with a buckskin flap which covered the
wearer&rsquo;s buttocks. The Indian women&rsquo;s aprons were commonly made
of shredded incense-cedar, willow, or juniper bark, or of tules. In
the case of Yana and Yahi women, frequently grass or shredded,
spring-gathered, broad-leaf maple bark were used. The latter was
a favorite valley Maidu skirt material. The double aprons might
however be made of whole buckskin or of strips or cords of buckskin,
and in winter furs might be used for the purpose. The double
apron is recognized as the standard garb of California Indian
women. That of the Maidu was often very narrow, being not much
more than a front and a rear tassel.</p>

types of baskets. The bottoms of which are devoid both of design and

</div>
<p>Women&rsquo;s casual aprons and other clothing were not highly
ornamented, but &ldquo;dress-up&rdquo; clothes might be fairly elaborately
trimmed. Fringing of buckskin, spangles of shell money and ornaments,
strings of shell beads, pine nuts, deer hoofs, and special
white grass fringes commonly decorated their better clothes.</p>
<p>In the summer some men, and particularly old ones wore nothing
at all. Most others wore very little clothing besides a sort of loin
covering of buckskin or fur which went between the legs and was
held in place back and front by a belt about the waist. A crude
buckskin shirt without sleeves was sometimes used.</p>
<p>During winter above aprons, skirts, or loin covering other garments
were worn. Then men commonly wore the sleeveless buckskin
shirt. Both sexes usually wore robes of woven rabbit skins (usually
imported by the Atsugewi), or made of deer or bear fur and worn
with the hair side inside. Or else the robes were of a patchwork
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
of small mammal skins sewn together. These same robes were
frequently used for bedding at night. As a matter of fact almost
any sort of skins available might be used as robes. These were
tied on in a variety of ways. The wearers must have presented a
rather motley appearance. On occasion small poncho style robes
with a central hole for the head and neck clothed the upper bodies
of local Indians during cold weather.</p>

<p>Thumbless mittens were made of cased skins of weasels, rats

Atsugewi also utilized their fur-lined quivers as muffs when
hunting.</p>
<p>California Indians spent much of the time barefoot, but wore
buckskin moccasins at war, on long hunts or journeys. Different
styles were made by each of the local tribes. None, however, were
normally decorated. Mountain Maidu also made moccasins of fur
with the hair side in, and Atsugewi stuffed pounded grass or grass
into their footwear or wore grass or tule slippers inside their
moccasins during the winter. Maidu put soft grass or sedges in
their moccasins for added warmth. An extra sole of tougher leather
such as elkskin was sometimes sewn onto the moccasin, but this
was not customary.</p>
<p>Occasionally open sandals held on by three or four thongs were
worn by Atsugewi and Yana.</p>

<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
bands. Atsugewi sometimes employed fur pieces, twined tule, or
spiral wrap-around fur strip leggings. Maidu used deerhide leggings
with the hair side inside. These went from ankles to above the
knees where they were tied, and were held close to the leg by an
outside spirally wound thong from top to bottom.</p>
<p>Snowshoes were a necessity too in the rigorous climate of even
the lower portions of the areas inhabited by tribes of the Lassen
area, particularly in those of the Atsugewi and mountain Maidu.
Snowshoes of the former Indians were circular in plan; those of the
latter were oval. Snowshoes were fashioned from small green
wooden limbs shaped while hot, and then crisscrossed with strips
of buckskin or hide with the fur side down for better traction.
Atsugewi used green juniper limbs for the purpose. Since the whole
foot was bound firmly to this footgear, there was no heel play as
in the case of white mans&rsquo; snowshoes.</p>

<br />BEAUTY AND PERSONAL GROOMING</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Of Atsugewi standards of beauty Garth states: &ldquo;The ideal
woman was short but plump and solidly built so that she could
do much work. A slim woman was considered too weak, and
a very tall woman was made fun of and called lohkata (stick
woman). Heavy breasts, a straight slim nose, large eyes,
long black hair, and small feet were all admirable qualities.
A girl with big feet was likely to be lazy, also a small foot
was desirable because it would not take so large a moccasin.
A mother pressed her girl child&rsquo;s foot together to make it
slender. The ideal man was of average height and was heavy
set. If a child had a flat nose, his mother pinched it and tried
to give it a higher bridge. Bow legs, it was said, might be
straightened by the mother when the child was young. Also
a child&rsquo;s ears were pressed against his head; if the ears stood
out, this was thought to indicate poor hearing. A slim hand
indicated a lazy person; a short stubby hand signified a good
worker.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Garth also comments to the effect that evidently the ideals of
Indian beauty had a very practical basis. The same general criteria
of beauty and desirability of women seem to have prevailed among
the other tribes of this region also, but Yana preferred a rather flat
and broad faced feminine beauty.</p>
<p>The hair of both men and women among California Indians was
generally worn long. The tribes of the Lassen area were no exception.
However, bangs on the forehead were known. Boys and girls
let their hair hang loosely, except that Atsugewi sometimes cut
small boys&rsquo; hair short to make it grow better later.</p>
<p>Women usually parted their hair in the middle wearing it in two
hanks, one hanging in front of each shoulder. Each was tied with
a piece of rawhide. Women of Yana tribes often used strips of otter
or mink fur for the purpose as did some Atsugewi. Yana women
might add further decoration in the form of a small string of shell
beads. Atsugewi women might paint their scalps at the part in the
hair with red paint.</p>
<p>The male Indian tied his hair in a bunch which hung down the
back. All local tribes, except mountain Maidu, seem also to have
frequently used a small mesh hairnet made of plant fibers with a
buckskin band to hold a man&rsquo;s hair in a sort of roll at the back of
his head. Maidu called the net wee-kah. In preparation for war or
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
for the hunt Yana men coiled their hair on their heads with well
defined top knots. For dances and other special events, male
Maidu and Yana, if rich, wore mesh bonnets thickly covered with
white eagle down feathers tied in so that the net strands were not
visible. Bone hairpins were sometimes used among Yana and
mountain Maidu men.</p>

<p>Adults cut their hair off with stone knives to show grief and
mourning when relatives died. Both men and women cropped their
hair closely, but mountain Maidu women sometimes only trimmed it
off to shoulder length. Singeing instead of cutting the hair was
sometimes resorted to.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>For combing the hair, Atsugewi might use a single stick, a pine
cone, or a teasle burr. Mountain Maidu might use stiff pine needles,
but the item most commonly used by all tribes for the purpose was
the porcupine tail. The animal&rsquo;s tail was skinned out, stuffed with
grass, and sewed shut at the open end. Sharp ends of the porcupine
quills were blunted with hot stones.</p>
<p>Hair was not dyed in this region. It was, however, rubbed with
animal fat or bone marrow to make it look nicer by aboriginal
standards. Atsugewi are said to have perfumed their hair on occasion
with aromatic plant foliage. Hair and body lice were not
uncommon; these were hunted and removed by hand. Maidu washed
their hair frequently with common soaproot (<i>Chlorogalum pomeridianum</i>).</p>
<p>Faces of adults were painted for a number of occasions. Black
was used to some extent by both sexes to prevent sunburn and
snow-blindness if long exposure in the bright sun were expected.
Although Yana men and women used red and white paint when
dancing, among our other tribes face paint was used chiefly by men
for dances and ceremonies.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig130">
<img src="images/p35d.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="516" />
<p class="pcap">Porcupine tail comb about ten inches long (after Dixon)</p>
</div>
<p>Paint pigments were mixed with animal fat, especially deer
grease, or with marrow and applied with the fingers. It was smeared
on upper arms, legs, chest, and cheeks. Atsugewi and mountain
Maidu blackened their eyebrows. Red pigment was either red soil,
usually roasted or burned to make the color brighter, or the spores
from a fungus which grows on the bark of fir trees. The fungus
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
material was dried over a slow fire to prepare it for use. Black
pigment was universally charcoal. Ashes were not used as white
pigment. Students of local tribes state that chalk was employed
for white paint. However, chalk is lacking in the Lassen vicinity
and it is highly probable that the suitable and readily available
white diatomaceous earth deposits were used for this purpose
instead. Atsugewi also used blue color which was obtained in
rock form by trade with their northern Pit River or Achomawi
neighbors.</p>
<p>The light beards which started to grow on male Indians&rsquo; faces
were universally removed completely by plucking with the fingers.</p>
<p>Earlobe and nose piercing was generally practiced by both
sexes. Among Atsugewi rims of their ears as well as the lobes
were perforated in some instances.</p>
<p>Tattooing was occasionally done by Yana, but not as commonly
as among Atsugewi where women not infrequently wore tattooed
vertical lines across their mouths. Both sexes commonly tattooed
their cheeks with horizontal lines or with two or three lines radiating
from the corners of the mouth. Arms and legs were also
tattooed to a certain extent. The mutilation was done by rubbing
charcoal into cuts which had been made with stone knives or by
rubbing charcoal on the skin and then pricking it with bone awls
or porcupine quills. However, even among Atsugewi, tattooing was
by no means universal. Mountain Maidu women were sometimes
tattooed with three, five, or seven vertical lines on the chin.</p>
<p>Earrings were worn by nearly all men and women. Atsugewi
employed bone rings, clamshell beads, feathers and even painted
ear ornaments. Mountain Maidu and Yana usually used bone or
wooden ones, plain or decorated with feathers or shells. Abalone,
like other sea shells, were received only in trade and were
fashioned into pendants for ears or noses.</p>
<p>Nose piercing consisted of making a hole through the septum
of the nose. This practice was popular among all local tribes. It
was done to permit the wearing of jewelry although Yana ascribed
a deeper meaning to the custom as well. They believed that no
person would go to his equivalent of heaven unless the nose
septum was pierced. Hence this was done to the dead and a stick
inserted if it had not been done in life. Two-pointed bone nose-pins
were popular inserts as were long narrow dentalium shells,
or nose pendants of beads. Only among mountain Maidu were nose
ornaments highly decorated.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>Necklaces were common adornments too, but local tribes did
not use bracelets. Items used for necklaces were perhaps bear
teeth and bear claws among Atsugewi and Yana. More commonly,
certainly, and used by all of our tribes were olivella shells, shaped
pieces of abalone shells, small animal and bird bone rings or tubes,
clamshell discs, long tooth-shells (dentalia), and Digger Pine
nuts which had been parched until blackened. Their ends had then
been rubbed off or holes bored through ends or sides and cleaned
out. Yana also made mussel shell disks locally, not only for necklaces
but as ear pendants. In later years all tribes used glass
trader beads, usually interspersed with native items.</p>
<p>Maidu, especially their tribes of the lower elevations, went in for
elaborate feather decorations and headdresses. Valley Maidu even
had feather cloaks for ceremonial use.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">Chapter XVII</span>
<br />WEALTH</h2>
<p>Among local tribes wealth was the direct result of skill and
industry and was highly regarded by all. A person&rsquo;s social status
in the tribe varied directly with his wealth. Lazy persons not able
to properly care for their own needs were considered as bums and
looked down upon by all other members of the village. With wealth
went a certain amount of power. Chiefs, although empowered by
heritage, were always well to do, and the wealthiest men in smaller
units acted in the capacity of head-men.</p>
<p>As with modern man, money among Indians was an arbitrary
medium of exchange, yet it was of more practical value to the
Indians than our own coins are to us. Their money was prized not
only for what it would buy in material things, but as possessing
important decorative value as well.</p>
<p>The long tooth-shell or dentalium was used whole and unmodified.
It was the currency of the northwest California coast. The
money of central and southern California was the clamshell disk.
This was cut, smoothed into disk shapes about half an inch in diameter,
and each was perforated with a central hole by means of
which this money could be strung onto cords. In no case did local
tribes travel the California coast to obtain these shell coins. Instead,
this item found its way to Indians of the interior through
progressive or step-by-step trading from coastal tribes through intermediate
aboriginal traders.</p>
<p>As we might expect, dentalia, having a northern origin, were
secured by Atsugewi not from their neighbors to the south, but from
the northern Yana in exchange for buckskins, arrows, wildcat skin
quivers, and woodpecker scalps. The mountain Maidu did not have
dentalia at all.</p>
<p>Except for the central Yana custom of measuring the length of
strings of clamshell disks, amounts of money were determined by
counting and not by measuring length on arm tatoos as was so
commonly the case in other parts of California. Skins of small
mammals which had been skinned by making only one slit in the
hind quarters and whose mouth openings had been tied shut, served
as purses.</p>
<p>All of our tribes used clamshell money. Among Yana clamshell
disks were not as valuable as dentalia, and they were more common
also among Atsugewi, the dentalia being used more for decoration
than as money. The tribes of the Lassen region generally received
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
the finished clamshell money; almost never did they manufacture
this, although they did work traded abalone shell into jewelry
pieces.</p>
<p>Material wealth or treasure other than weapons, skins, baskets,
and food also consisted largely of imported seashells. Whole
olivella shells were commonly used as dress ornaments and also
for paying shamans for services. Bone cylinders, columellae of
shells, and especially polished cylinders of the mineral magnesite
were highly prized. These might be used as the central piece of
a necklace in the same manner that we might utilize a precious
gem.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">Chapter XVIII</span>
<br />CEREMONIAL DRESS</h2>
<p>All local tribes used the beautiful salmon colored feathers of
the Red-shafted Flicker, a woodpecker also known to us by the
name Yellowhammer. A headband of the bird&rsquo;s feathers&mdash;the stiff
quills&mdash;was worn on the forehead. Mountain Maidu doctors wore
this item also as a belt. In addition Atsugewi made a full feather
band which was worn in a variety of ways including hanging down
the back. This was usually used only by the shamans.</p>
<p>Another ceremonial item was the California or Acorn Woodpecker
scalp headband. This usually had a buckskin strap base, however,
mountain Maidu glued these gay feathered patches onto fur bands,
Yana wore woodpecker scalps on buckskin as belts.</p>
<p>Mountain Maidu made belts of bands on which the showy greenish
feathered neck skins of male Mallard Ducks in mating plumage
were strung.</p>
<p>For ceremonial use it was generally customary to tuck small
tufts of feathers into the top of the hair. Among Atsugewi, chiefs
only used eagle feathers for this purpose. This tribe also fastened
single feathers into the crown of buckskin caps in a radiating
manner, and also onto strips hanging down the back. Sometimes
feathers were tipped with small white feathers to make the former
even more decorative. Feathers were also fastened to head nets
in a number of ways which differed somewhat among our tribes.
Among Atsugewi, women wore these on occasion, but generally it
was the males who decked themselves with feathers. Feather
plumes of various sorts, employing either twisted buckskin or stick
bodies, were also in general use.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">Chapter XIX</span>
<br />TOBACCO AND SMOKING</h2>
<p>The knowledge and use of tobacco are among the important
elements which our own culture of today has inherited from the
Indians of North America. Of what benefit this has been is a debatable
matter, but its effect has been profound, both on our customs
and our economy.</p>
<p>Local tribes used simple one piece wooden pipes of tubular
design for the most part in smoking tobacco. Atsugewi and mountain
Maidu commonly employed elder and other woods with a pithy
and easily removed center. Although not otherwise being considered
in this account, the Shasta Indian technique of pipe making is
mentioned here because of its uniqueness. These folks hollowed
pipe stems by soaking the end of a suitable stick in salmon oil.
The larvae of the salmon fly were then introduced, and these worm-like
creatures, eating the nourishing fishy core, would bore their
ways lengthwise through the center of the heartwood where most
of the salmon oil was concentrated. The Yana habitually used the
wood of ash as pipe stock. Mountain Maidu found but did not manufacture
a few simple stone pipe bowls also of tubular design. These
had considerable spiritual significance and were treated with great
care. Garth states that Atsugewi also had short stone pipes,
tubular in shape, to which elder or rose wood extensions up to
eleven inches in length were applied. Stone pipes were apparently
not common in the Lassen region, however.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig134">
<img src="images/p37.jpg" alt="" width="573" height="410" />
<p class="pcap">Steatite stone pipes were used without wooden stems, each between
three and four inches long. The holes in such pipes were made by
tapping a deer antler piece in the depression containing some sand,
a slow but effective boring process. This was commonly done by
Valley tribes.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<div class="img" id="fig135">

<p class="pcap">Yana reddish porous lava
(dacite?) pipe, broken half,

</div>
<p>Pipes were used at social gatherings, after sweating, and at
bed time. The pipes of the local tribes did not have any bends or
curves. These straight tubular pipes were therefore most conveniently
smoked when the Indians were reclining on their backs
thus keeping the tobacco from falling out. Pipes were normally
passed around, and used only by the men. However, women shamans
of the mountain Maidu also smoked them. Shamans regularly used
pipe smoking in ceremonies, especially when healing the sick.</p>
<p>Tobacco grew wild and burning of brush was performed in certain
localities to promote the growth of <i>Nicotiana</i> plants. Tobacco
was not cultivated, but mountain Maidu did collect and scatter
seeds in favorable areas. Tobacco was prepared merely by collecting
the leaves when fully developed but still green, then drying,
preferably in the shade, and finally crumbling the cured leaf in the
hand. Tobacco was carried in buckskin pouches usually. Atsugewi
often added manzanita and deer grease to their smoking tobacco.
Indians of this region did not chew tobacco nor did they eat it with
lime as was the custom elsewhere in California. Native tobacco
is quite strong.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">Chapter XX</span>
<br />MUSIC AND ART</h2>
<p>Music of local tribes was limited indeed. It was usually made
by men. Only Atsugewi among the Lassen tribes possessed the
drum, and this is believed to have been of recent introduction. It
was a tambourine type: flat, cylindrical, a foot or so across, and
with buckskin shrunken over one end.</p>
<p>The shamans of all tribes used cocoon rattles. These were
made of large cocoons from which the moth pupae had been removed
through a small hole. Pebbles or seeds were then inserted and
usually five or six cocoons&mdash;among Atsugewi as many as thirty&mdash;were
tied onto the end of a wooden handle and dried. Cocoon
rattles were considered dangerous and were usually kept hidden out
of doors, being used by shamans only when doctoring.</p>
<p>A single split stick clapper was employed generally for all types
of singing and dancing, not being reserved for any special type of
person or ceremony.</p>
<p>Deer-hoof rattles were made from the small hard &ldquo;dew-claws&rdquo;
from the backs of deer legs. About twenty dew-claws were tied
loosely with thongs to a strip of buckskin which was then wrapped
about a stick with a plain handle. The deer-hoof rattle was operated
by vigorously jerking it lengthwise, in and out. It was used
exclusively in the important puberty rites when girls attained
womanhood.</p>

<p class="pcap">Flute and bull-roarer of local manufacture</p>
</div>
<p>Atsugewi and Yana employed hunting bows as musical instruments
by holding one end in the mouth and plucking the string with
fingers. Mountain Maidu did so too, but like the others only for
their own amusement.</p>
<p>Bone, cane, and elder whistles were blown at dances. Flutes,
the most tuneful of Indians&rsquo; instruments, were not played at ceremonies
or at dances, curiously enough, but just for self amusement,
or in the case of mountain Maidu also for courting pretty girls. Flute
melodies were supposed to tell stories, but words were not sung
to help the interpretation. Yana made a six-hole flute; other tribes
of the Lassen area used a four hole model. In all cases they were
open, reedless instruments blown at an angle across one end. The
flute was most frequently made of elder wood&mdash;mountain Maidu
burned the holes into it with live coals.</p>
<p>Except for basketry designs art as such is virtually non-existent.
A few simple designs were painted onto hunting bows, and some
nose and ear pendants might be considered jewelry art forms, but
of the lowest development. The application of face and body paints
and tattooing were also simple examples of Indian art.</p>
<p>There appear to be no cliff or cave paintings in the vicinity of
Lassen Peak, but they are abundant in Lava Beds National Monument
about 75 miles to the north. A different matter is that of
petroglyphs which, in California, usually have been made by striking
or pecking smooth rock surfaces with small hard stones. Some of
these are to be found in the Atsugewi and central Yana territories
at lower elevation. However, these symbolic markings were not
executed by the local tribes. Atsugewi believe them to have been
made by mythological characters. It appears that the petroglyphs
must have been made by the predecessors of the Hat Creek and
Nozi Indians, for these people claim no knowledge of even the
meaning of the rock writings. Shortly before going to press the
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
first petroglyph known to come from the Lassen vicinity was found
in the territory of the Southern Yana. The site is one where numerous
obsidian chips and arrowpoints have been found on a gently
south sloping, open forested portion of Lassen Volcanic National
Park headquarters area at an elevation of almost 5000 feet and
situated slightly west of the village of Mineral and just north of
the north edge of Battle Creek Meadow.</p>
<p>This find on a 10 inch boulder appears to be of ancient origin.
The surface has weathered considerably yet not so much that the
character of the carving has been altered. It is apparent that the
quarter inch deep grooves have been made by rubbing rather than
by pecking with hard rocks. This is all the more interesting since
the boulder bearing the carving is of a tough hard and site lava.
It is indeed unfortunate that the significance of this Battle Creek
Meadows petroglyph is unknown. The authorities venture the
opinion that the stone may have been used in puberty ceremonies.
If so, whether by the Southern Yana or their predecessors we do
not know either.</p>

much shallower troughs with rounded bottoms some being quite vague. B,

<br />GAMES AND SOCIAL GATHERINGS</h2>
<p>Heavy betting on games was the rule. Games were commonly
played between neighboring villages or even on occasion with
neighboring tribes. Gambling was an important element in these
contests and large sums were bet. Sometimes nearly all of a
person&rsquo;s or even of a group&rsquo;s possessions were at stake.
Evaluation of the stakes in white man&rsquo;s terms is difficult, but they
are said frequently to have been of the order of several hundred
dollars or even as much as a thousand dollars. Important games
lasted more than one day&mdash;perhaps three or four days. The players
caught brief rests only and were completely exhausted by the
time the playing was over. Singing was the usual accompaniment
and high quality rendition at games was much admired. Cheating was
rare, maybe because it was supposed to bring subsequent bad luck.</p>
<p>Most games were guessing games. There was considerable
variety in the character and number of gambling stones or wooden
sticks used, the manner of shuffling and other details. The sticks
were shuffled and then concealed in the hands of one or several
players on one side. The opposition had to determine the location
of the marked stick or the arrangement of several. There were
many spectators and excitement ran high. Women occasionally
participated along with the men who were the main contestants.
Counting sticks might be supplied to each side in equal number at
the beginning. More often, however, the sticks were all placed in
a common pile at the outset, the successful side taking a counting
stick with each win. These scoring sticks were taken and surrendered
as the tide of the game changed until one side had all.
The game was won at this point.</p>
<p>Ball games were played too. The ball was of buckskin stuffed
with hair. The object was to kick the ball between the other team&rsquo;s
goal posts. Kicking ball races over given courses and back, or
around a lake shore, were also indulged in. In some contests the
men and youths on opposing sides would engage in restraining each
other so that a number of individual or group wrestling bouts
developed on the playing field.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig145">
<img src="images/p40.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="125" />
<p class="pcap">Yana gambling bone, four inches long</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>There were foot races of distances either short or up to fifteen
miles or so in length. Also archery contests and wrestling matches
were held. In wrestling the object was to throw the opponent to
the ground; tripping was not allowed. Contests in which heavy
rocks were tossed, somewhat in the manner of today&rsquo;s shot-put,
and heavier rocks carried in competition over a designated line
were other games in which the Atsugewi engaged.</p>
<p>Shinny was played by women and children as well as by men,
but adult sexes played separately in all of our tribes except Yana.
Among them only men participated in this game. Mountain Maidu
had three players on a side; Atsugewi had five players. Straight
shinny sticks curved at the striking end were used and the puck
was a hide affair. Mountain Maidu used a double ball puck. An
attempt was made to keep the puck in the air in play. The object,
of course, was to get the puck to go between the opponents&rsquo; goal
posts. The Yana used a puck of two bones linked by a string
several inches long. Running with the puck on the stick as well
as hitting, and throwing it down the field were permitted.</p>
<p>Children improvised a number of games in the
same manner as our own children do today in copying
their parents. They played house with limbless
but dressed dolls, made and used toy bows and
arrows, and made sling shots, too. They commonly
tried juggling two stones in one hand, spun acorn
tops by hand, and in some instances noise makers
such as wooden buzzers and bull roarers were
used. In play, loud noise was not condoned, however.</p>
<p>Small feasts might occur at any time and were
perhaps the most important social gatherings of
Atsugewi. They were usually sparked by a temporary
abundance of food. Dancing was not included.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig146">
<img src="images/p40a.jpg" alt="" width="154" height="499" />
<p class="pcap">Child&rsquo;s

</div>
<p>Mr. Garth describes the Atsugewi &ldquo;... grand occasion
... held only when a large supply of food had been accumulated,
was the bagapi or &lsquo;big time&rsquo;.... The chief called a
meeting to decide on the date and then sent his people to
various places for deer and other foods. Knotted strings
(rokuki) with a knot tied for each intervening day before the
festival were sent to other villages. By untying a knot each
day other chieftains knew when to start for the host&rsquo;s village.
The host chief stood on the roof of his earth lodge and
welcomed the visitor, calling each chief by name: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t fall
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
down. Step carefully. I&rsquo;m glad you have come to see me.
Don&rsquo;t be in a hurry.&rsquo;... Toward evening the visitors might
give a dance, after which the host chief called everyone to
eat. Large baskets containing acorn mush, meat, sunflower
seeds, and other foods were placed on the ground. The host
proffered baskets of food to each visiting chief who in turn
then distributed the food to his people. In winter two tribal
groups on opposite sides of the sweat house might have a
competitive sweat dance, vying to see which could endure the
heat longest. In summer the sweating was usually omitted,
and games of chance were begun. In the several days that
followed, foot racing, archery, weight lifting, and other contests
were indulged in. Large bets were made by opposing
sides on the outcome of each contest, and the losing side at
the end of the week&rsquo;s festivities often had little property left.
Surplus food was divided among the guests before they
departed.&rdquo;</p>

<br />DANCES</h2>
<p>Mountain Maidu had more dances and more types of dances than
other tribes of the Lassen area. Tribes of the Sacramento Valley
had many more and more complicated dance ceremonies than ours
did.</p>
<p>Mountain Maidu had formalized sweat dances which were performed
inside large dwelling lodges at night and were participated
in by both sexes. As in the case of Yana, only one man, the leader,
sang and hit the central pole rhythmically with a split stick rattle.
The dancers performed simultaneously but in one spot until they
were exhausted and took a cold swim afterwards.</p>
<p>Of the less ceremonial Atsugewi sweat dance, Garth states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;... Men danced naked except for circlets ... of
twisted grass around the waist, head and upper arm, and occasionally
from one shoulder diagonally across the chest....
Three or four lines of black or white paint might be drawn
across the chest and upper arm. Women wore a skirt and only
a small amount of paint. The dancing took place in the combination
sweat, dance, and dwelling house of the chief or head
man.... The fire was built high with dry mountain mahogany
..., pine ..., and sometimes with willow ..., all
woods which burned without much smoke; the ventilator door
was closed and the dance began. The one singer sat in a
corner and beat time with a split stick rattle.... Each of ten
or twelve dancers might approach close to the fire to show
his ability to endure heat, pick up burning brands, one in each
hand, and alternately hit one upper arm and then the other with
the brands. The heat often became so intense that water had
to be thrown on the center post to prevent its catching fire.
There was rivalry to see who could stay inside longest, and
after a time one man after another emerged and dived into the
icy water nearby or rolled in the snow. There might be sweating
three or four nights in succession on the occasion of a
communal hunt.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mountain Maidu held a dance gathering each spring for Black
Bear and Grizzly Bear. They believed that this dance had been
done by animals in mythical &ldquo;before Indian times&rdquo;. This gathering
lasted three days and nights, but the actual dance was in progress
only one day and night. Only women danced but men participated
in the ceremony dressed in bear robes. There was much feasting
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
too.</p>
<p>The pre- and post-war dances are discussed under the chapter
on war.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">Chapter XXIII</span>
<br />POLITICAL ORGANIZATION OF TRIBES</h2>
<p>Tribes, as we think of them, were non-existent as political
units, and hence there were no tribal chiefs, but there were village
chiefs, in the California province.</p>
<p>The self governing unit was always a village or a group of small
closely adjacent villages. This is the political unit which was
governed by the chief. Villages might consist of from four to about
twenty-five earth lodges and bark huts with populations of from
twenty-five to a hundred or more persons. Influential leaders,
usually of much wealth&mdash;but not necessarily so&mdash;were recognized
as head-men, exercising considerable authority over the smaller
villages or separated groups of houses near villages. However the
head-man&rsquo;s authority was subservient to that of the chief.</p>
<p>Chieftainship was inherited through the father&rsquo;s lineage, the
oldest son being the first in succession. However, if the son were
too young to take over, the deceased chief&rsquo;s brother was temporarily
in charge. The qualities of good character and knowledge were also
important qualifications for chieftainship, and a chief could be
deposed if he were not a good one. Tenure was normally for life,
dependent upon satisfactory behavior and performance of his responsibilities.</p>
<p>The chief&rsquo;s relatives hunted and fished for him, but he fed
visitors and provided most of the food for feasts. The chief always
directed community economic activities such as group fishing, deer
hunting, and root digging expeditions. For this reason chiefs had
to know much about game, fish runs, ripening seasons, et cetera,
and had to possess good judgement to insure success of group
undertakings. Chiefs also spoke to their people mornings and
evenings, and at ceremonies and the like. Chiefs furthermore declared
days of rest when chores were done about home. Another
function was to arbitrate quarrels among the people.</p>
<p>Mountain Maidu villages had assistant chiefs besides, who were
sons or brothers of the chiefs. This assistant advised the chief
and substituted for him as the occasion demanded. A specific duty
of his was the division of food at ceremonies.</p>
<p>Some chiefs had secondary female chiefs who in the case of
the Maidu were daughters, among Atsugewi the chiefs&rsquo; wives. A
woman in this capacity supervised preparation of food for feasts
and in Atsugewi villages might give orders to men.</p>
<p>Atsugewi chiefs appointed clowns at ceremonies who were paid.
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
Appointed messengers were a part of every chief&rsquo;s staff. They
were selected on the basis of both willingness to serve and ability.
Maidu had about six messengers per village while the number varied
among Atsugewi. Messengers were good speakers, reliable men,
and were discharged if they failed in their duties. These included
not only message running, but among Atsugewi, tending fires at
ceremonies. For Maidu chiefs, messengers welcomed guests and
traveled about gathering news and scouting. Special fire tenders
were appointed in this tribe.</p>
<p>Atsugewi chiefs seem to have possessed greater prestige and
authority than those of the mountain Maidu, the Yana, and the Yahi.
The decisions of Atsugewi chiefs were final, but these had to be
diplomatic if the chief were to remain popular. If a chief were unpopular
some of his people would move to another village leaving
the first chief&rsquo;s community numerically weaker. Chiefs were generally
well obeyed by rich and poor alike. In return, chiefs unfailingly
had the interests of their people at heart. Atsugewi chiefs,
specifically, set examples of industry, behavior, and judgement
for their people. No doubt this was generally true of the chiefs
of units in other local tribes too.</p>
<p>Because of the greater popularity, prestige, and consequently
larger following of some individual chiefs, they were considerably
more powerful than other chiefs in the same tribe. Such men were
influential to some extent beyond the boundaries of their own territories.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="small">Chapter XXIV</span>
<br />WAR AND PEACE</h2>
<p>Wars were commonly small scale encounters and might be either
within tribes or between tribes. Atsugewi were not often aggressive.
Most tribes at one time or another had differences with neighboring
tribes, but friendly relations were usually re-established soon.
Certain tribes, however, were repeatedly or traditionally enemies,
as for instance, Klamath, Paiute, or Modoc against Atsugewi;
Washoe against mountain Maidu; Achomawi or Wintun against the
Yana tribes; and mountain Maidu or Wintun against Yahi. Tribes
sometimes helped each other in wars, and either payment or reciprocal
aid was usually forthcoming.</p>
<p>Causes of hostilities in the Lassen area were usually revenge
for murders (if uncompensated), abduction of women and children,
or insults to chiefs. Mountain Maidu, Yana, and Yahi also waged
wars on account of poaching, rape, alleged witchcraft, and the like.
All able bodied men normally went to war, but mountain Maidu left
some at home to protect the women.</p>
<p>Chiefs generally did not participate in the fighting although
they often went along on the war expedition. Instead of leading
the battles themselves, chiefs appointed special warrior leaders
who were principal targets of the opposition. Such battle leaders
were often head-men, but always were men competent to lead the
fight and who had good arrow dodging power.</p>
<p>Shamans habitually went to war, but did not fight actively except
on occasion. They were busy singing during battle and urging
the warriors on or exhorting supernatural help. The Atsugewi
shaman reportedly &ldquo;stayed behind a tree all the time giving out
his power&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Preparation for war consisted of practicing dodging arrows,
shooting arrows, in some cases at effigies, and in dancing. The
main purpose of the preparation was to incite enthusiasm for the
fight. This was so successful that quite a commotion developed
in the community, to the extent that such incidents occurred
as warriors with knives chasing women and a man shooting his own
dog with an arrow! Preparatory war dances were held outside near
the villages. Both men and women participated and shamans sang.
Mountain Maidu sustained their dances for several days. Warriors
spoke to their arrows addressing them as persons. Atsugewi men
painted themselves with white and black stripes on faces, limbs,
and bodies. Yana used red and white war paint. Mountain Maidu
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
wore head nets and bands. Dried untanned skins of bear, elk, and
such were worn at dances as well as in battle, as were waistcoat
armors of strong vertical sticks lashed together. Leather helmets
were worn by some warriors.</p>
<p>The enemy was usually attacked just at dawn using the element
of surprise to the fullest extent possible. Some battles were pre-arranged
in which a number of participants faced each other in well
formed lines. Such conflicts were subject to &ldquo;calling off&rdquo; if too
many men were injured or killed. Serious raids, however, did
not give quarter and men, women, and children were killed. Booty
was taken and scalps, too, were stripped from fallen victims.
Scalps were later burned by Atsugewi, but mountain Maidu dried
human scalps on frames. This tribe also took entire heads from
bodies on occasion. Prisoners were taken too: Atsugewi not infrequently
adopted captured children. Captive women might be
mistreated and raped, then killed. Adult prisoners might escape
with relative ease because there was no suitable way to confine
them permanently, and some were returned voluntarily.</p>
<p>While the war party was away on its expedition, the women at
home danced individually in the manner of the war dance. They
sang and prayed to help the men at war. Atsugewi women dancers
carried feathers, bows, and arrows, but rattles were not used in
these morale dances.</p>
<p>Upon return of the war party a victory dance was held in or near
the village in the open air. Men and women danced independently,
but together at the same time. Atsugewi men painted themselves
red and white instead of the black and white used for the pre-war
dance. They wore headdresses of all sorts and the warriors
carried their bows, arrows, armor, and other fighting gear while
dancing. The victory dance took place around a fire. Next to the fire
Atsugewi planted a short pole on which the new scalps were displayed
while mountain Maidu danced with the scalps secured to
hand-carried sticks. It is worth noting that while some readers
may consider this gloating over human scalps to be a primitive
morbidity, it is true that often white men&mdash;the very pioneers we
eulogize&mdash;took and coveted human scalps themselves.</p>
<p>Warriors, particularly those who had killed adversaries, purified
themselves by swimming, rubbing aromatic plants on their bodies,
praying for luck. They did not eat meat for from a few to many days,
depending on the tribe. Among Atsugewi they also sweated with
the same end in view, and women brushed the men&rsquo;s bodies with
plant materials to aid the purification process.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Surprisingly, the eating of hot foods and any form of meat was
taboo to wounded warriors. This seems strange, since these are
the very foods which we consider beneficial to injured persons.</p>
<p>When an attack appeared likely upon an Atsugewi village, the
whole population retired to high ground which was easily defended.
Such sites were prepared in advance and might be considered crude
forts as they were surrounded by rock walls and provided with
shelters for the non-combatants.</p>
<p>In intertribal wars there was usually no compensation as such
made where the encounter had been motivated by the satisfaction
of securing revenge. In the case of feuds or murders within the
tribe payment was made to relatives of the slain. If persons on
both sides were slain compensation was made for all the dead.
The chief or head-man supervised the peace negotiations. Payment
was usually in beads or money, but Atsugewi sometimes paid off
in women or in the amount of the usual price of a bride. In this
tribe too, the amount of compensation was made according to the
wealth of the victim. A poor man&rsquo;s life was not considered to be
worth as much as a rich man&rsquo;s. Atsugewi had a settlement dance
meeting in which both sides were present and wore fighting regalia.
These dancers disarmed themselves after the payment had been
made.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<h2 id="c27"><span class="small">Chapter XXV</span>
<br />BIRTH AND BABIES</h2>
<p>The natural function of birth obviously varied only in details
of handling the situation, delivery assistance, disposition of the
afterbirth, and methods of cutting and treating the child&rsquo;s umbilical
cord. The baby was born in a separate hut which contained a trench
heated with coals. These were covered with grass and pine needles
or fir boughs. On this warm green bed the woman lay at least a
part of the time during labor and also after delivery.</p>
<p>Children were desired and a barren woman was looked down on
socially. Inability to produce children was grounds for divorce.
The behavior of both parents during pregnancy was believed to
closely affect personality and health of the child.</p>
<p>After giving birth, the mother remained in isolation for from nearly
a week to a month or more. Many taboos were imposed upon her.
Bathing in streams and sweat baths, eating fresh or dried meat or
fish, grease, and often salt were forbidden to her. Most tribes of
the Lassen area also prohibited combing of the mother&rsquo;s hair by
herself during the period of isolation. Also taboo was scratching
herself with her hands, making baskets, preparing food, or traveling.</p>

<p class="pcap">Atsugewi young baby carrying basket or teseh-nay-gow</p>
</div>
<p>There were restrictions on the father of the newly born child
too. Among Atsugewi and Yana he stayed with the mother, but
mountain Maidu fathers stayed away for periods of a week or less.
Immediately after the birth had taken place, the father ran to the
woods to break up and bring home quantities of fire-wood. Hunting
and fishing of all kinds and traveling were taboo for several weeks
in most cases. Atsugewi and mountain Maidu new fathers were also
forbidden to smoke and gamble, and like their wives, were denied
eating fresh or dried fish, meat, and grease for varying periods up
to a month. Release from taboos occurred with sweating and bathing
among Atsugewi and mountain Maidu. Fathers in these tribes
also gave away the first kill when they resumed hunting.</p>
<p>The mother generally massaged the infant to improve the shape
and proportion of nose, face, limbs, and torso. Shedding of the
baby&rsquo;s umbilical cord was an important event which the Indians
wished to occur as soon as possible. A variety of odd practices to
this end were employed. The occurrence of the event relieved the
parents of some, or in other cases of all, the post birth taboos.
Among most of our tribes the dried cord was saved until the child
reached manhood or womanhood. It was customarily secured to the
cradle basket, but frequently was subsequently lost. Earlobes
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
might be pierced in early infancy especially if the child were prone
to cry much.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig149">
<img src="images/p42.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="541" />
<p class="pcap">Atsugewi older baby carrying basket or yah-birr-dee. Note the rounded
bottom on A, a modernization. Partial illustration B shows old style construction
with a pointed bottom for thrusting into the ground.</p>
</div>
<p>Two cradle baskets were used. Mountain Maidu made two of
similar oval shape, but the first and smaller one was without a
hood. Atsugewi and Yana tribes made two different types, but both
with rounded carrying handles and sunshades on top. These were
constructed of willow ribs, pine root, and buckskin. The first small
basket was called tseh-nay-gow by Atsugewi and was used for
several months. It was short and with a distinctly rounded basketry
shelf or lip at its lower end. The larger baby basket was called
yah-bih-dee and was practically identical to that of the mountain
Maidu. This was made of the usual twined basketry materials, but
was of different construction. Willow ribs were lashed onto a sturdy
one-piece forked branch frame, the joint being at the bottom. The
base or stem of this Y-piece stuck out below for several inches
being sharpened so that it could be stuck into the ground near the
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
mother in camp or when she was out digging roots in the fields.
Boo-noo-koo-ee-menorra tells of an interesting modification of
the yah-bih-dee today. Its frame is now simply rounded at the
bottom instead of having the pointed end described above. &ldquo;Most
people have cars now a days&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;and that point poked a
hole through the seat of the car. So now we make the round kind.&rdquo;
Our visitors to Lassen Volcanic National Park are always interested
in names of the &ldquo;papoose basket&rdquo;. This term and the words
moccasin, wampum, and so on are no doubt of Indian origin being
the actual words or reasonable facsimiles thereof used by some
eastern tribe for the objects concerned. English speaking Americans
have adopted these names as meaning those particular articles for
all Indian tribes. It may be recalled that earlier in this book, it
was pointed out that each tribe had its own distinct language and
so, obviously, each tribe would have had its own distinct names
for these objects. Hence there is no all inclusive &ldquo;Indian name&rdquo;
for the cradle basket or anything else.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig150">
<img src="images/p42c.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="282" />
<p class="pcap">Maidu baby carrying basket about thirty five inches long.</p>
</div>
<p>The baby was wrapped in tanned buckskin or soft furs, normally
wildcat by the Atsugewi. A pad of grass or padded bark was placed
on the cradle board or basket and then the child was lashed into
the tshe-nay-gow with buckskin straps in a sitting position on the
sill with its feet hanging down. Most tribes used dry grass, pounded
until soft, for diapers, but mountain Maidu used skin material for
the purpose. Babies were kept in the cradle baskets until they
were able to walk. The cradle frame was carried on the mother&rsquo;s
back with a tump-line passing over her forehead or chest. A series
of larger cradle baskets were made as the child grew, usually three
before the child was allowed to crawl or walk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>The newborn infant was never fed the colostrum from its mother.
The baby was either let go without food or given a cooked meat
gruel for nourishment for the first two days or so until bonafide
milk was produced in the mother&rsquo;s breasts. Children were nursed
as often as they wished and until they were quite large: even three
or four years old.</p>
<p>Names were given to children usually at the age of about a year.
Yana waited even longer, however, until ages of four to six years
before giving real names which for this tribe were habitually of a
hereditary nature. In the meantime, temporary descriptive nicknames
were given. Many real Atsugewi names had meanings, while those
of mountain Maidu and Yana normally did not. Nevertheless, Yana
and to a certain extent other Indians too, might acquire additional
nicknames and descriptive names later in life, even in adulthood.</p>
<p>Twins were unwanted among all local tribes, probably because
of the double care and feeding responsibilities involved. Mountain
Maidu thought that twins were bad luck and actually feared them.
It was generally believed that twins were caused by the mother
having eaten twinned nutmeats. These, therefore, were carefully
avoided.</p>
<p>Killing newborn babies whether illegitimate, twins, crippled,
or when the mother died in childbirth, was practiced only on very
rare occasions. Certainly infanticide was not the rule among any
of the local tribes, but of course was practiced in certain other
areas.</p>

<br />ADULTHOOD RITES</h2>
<p>A girl&rsquo;s attainment of puberty or womanhood was an event of
obvious importance and it was recognized as such by all tribes of
the Lassen region with extensive formal ritual and ceremony for
each individual girl. Only the more important and generally employed
taboos and rites are noted below. There was considerable
variation in details of such matters even among the four tribes with
which we are dealing.</p>
<p>The girl was secluded in a separate hut for from three to six
days and sometimes during the nights too. The taboos she observed
during this time were much like those imposed on a mother giving
birth, but were even more extensive. The young lady must eat from
her own special baskets, not cross streams, avoid contacting men&mdash;especially
hunters, refrain from gazing at the sun or moon, et
cetera. Among things she must do were to wear a basketry cap, or
special head bands among some tribes, and have her hair put up in
two knobs wrapped over her shoulders. This had to be done for her
as she was not allowed to touch her own hair. Carrying the deer-hoof
rattle she must run races with other girls, and dance much
also, scratch her head only with a special scratcher, have her
earlobes pierced if this had not already been done, and frequently
her nose septum was punctured too, being kept open by insertion of
a round stick. Among Wintun tribes of the Sacramento Valley some
taboos lasted for from one to three years!</p>
<p>For several nights public dances were held which lasted all
night. Since there was no special ritual for anyone but the girl for
whom the dances were held, these ceremonies were of a joyous
nature and were popular and well attended. In the middle of the
night food provided by the girl&rsquo;s family was served to all present.
Singing with deer-hoof rattle accompaniment was carried on all
night. Intimate affairs between couples were not unusual during
such dances. During the daytime as well dances were held, but
these were of short duration and participated in chiefly by the
women of the village. At the end of the ordeal the girl bathed and
was given new clothes, ending her taboos.</p>
<p>There was no formal ceremony when boys attained manhood except
that the youths were generally sent alone into the neighboring
mountains for several days to seek special &ldquo;powers&rdquo; to give them
skill and luck in certain pursuits such as deer hunting, archery,
fighting, shamanism, and the like.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>During menstruation all women had to observe many taboos too.
These included eating alone and living in seclusion. They could
eat no meat or fish, fat, or salt, and must not cook. They must
avoid sick persons and hunters, and could not scratch themselves
except with the scratching stick. At the end of the taboo periods
of four or five days, they usually bathed in streams for purification.</p>
<p>Curiously, wives&rsquo; menstruations had to be observed by their
husbands in a number of ways. Most common was prohibition of
smoking, and they must eat lightly. Among mountain Maidu the
husband could hunt and fish, but could not eat any flesh; among
Atsugewi the reverse was true.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<h2 id="c29"><span class="small">Chapter XXVII</span>
<br />MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE</h2>
<p>Marriage itself was not formalized with any ceremony. It was
common practice for parents to arrange marriages when children
were young and these arrangements, which involved some exchange
of gifts or payment, were usually honored later. Most other
marriages were arranged by parents later when the children had
reached maturity and generally these recognized the children&rsquo;s
wishes. Both of these types of marriages were the basis for extensive
exchange of presents and visits, details of which differed
among the several tribes. In addition there was almost universal
payment for the girl&mdash;about ten strings of clamshell disks was
standard. The boy and girl became husband and wife simply upon
starting to live together, but the new status was usually marked by
a feast participated in by the families concerned. Generally there
followed a period of residence of the couple with one or both of the
in-laws. On occasion marriages grew from intimacies with no
parental negotiations, but such matches were not well regarded by
the community.</p>
<p>Indian men frequently married women from other villages and
occasionally even women from other tribes.</p>
<p>If a wife died her sister was generally obliged to marry the
widower. Likewise, if the husband died it was customary that his
brother would marry the widow. A wise institution was the relationship
of the husband and wife with their in-laws. Neither could
speak to nor hand things directly to the in-law of opposite sex,
or in some cases even to the brothers and sisters of the in-laws;
such things had to be done by a third party. In some instances the
mother-in-law even avoided looking at her son-in-law even though
she might like him. Such arrangements no doubt prevented many
arguments and quarrels, but as far as their own evaluation of these
customs were concerned, the basis lay in the belief that a bear
might eat either or both of the violators of the in-law taboos.</p>
<p>The practice of having more than one wife at a time was common.
One man might have three or four wives, but rarely had more than
two at a time. Rich men or head-men and chiefs were most apt to
have more than two wives.</p>
<p>Divorce was simple indeed. The man just sent the girl back
home if she were barren, lazy, promiscuous, or the like. If he had
good reasons for wanting to get rid of his wife, her purchase price
might be refunded by her family, or else the ex-wife&rsquo;s sister might
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
be sent to him in exchange, or, sometimes, in addition with no
additional payment. On the other hand, the wife might leave her
husband if she had been badly mistreated, or if the husband did not
provide enough meat and clothing for the family or if he were unfaithful.
In divorce the children were divided. Usually, but not
always, the girls remained with their mother and the boys with their
father. However, divorce was not common among Indians of this
region.</p>
<p>On the whole, morals were high and sexual deviations were infrequent,
although the whole range of such practices were known to
the aborigines. It appears beyond argument that divorces, moral
laxity, and sexual aberrations increased with the coming of white
man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<h2 id="c30"><span class="small">Chapter XXVIII</span>
<br />DEATH AND BURIAL</h2>
<p>Atsugewi and mountain Maidu left the corpse in the house for
one day. They prepared it for burial by dressing it well and adding
bead necklaces, then wrapping it in a hide. Yana did the same,
washing the body first, and although also adorning the corpse with
jewelry, they always removed decorative nose ornaments, replacing
these with simple sticks. According to Voegelin, Atsugewi removed
the body for burial prone and feet first through the wall of
the house, but Garth states that the body was removed through the
southern ventilator passage or through the regular entrance way
in the roof.</p>
<p>The mountain Maidu, Yana, Yahi, and usually the Atsugewi bent
the body into a position called flexed. The arms were folded across
the chest and the knees were drawn up against the stomach before
wrapping the corpse in a robe which was then sewn shut. The
mountain Maidu sometimes put the wrapped cadaver into a large
basket. Voegelin was of the opinion that Atsugewi buried their
dead lying flat on their backs, and if so, always with the head toward
the east. It is thought that this prone burial might be a
recent innovation learned from white man.</p>
<p>Mourners among all of our local tribes wailed aloud and brought
gifts for the dead. Women, especially the older ones, mourned
vigorously. To quote Garth again on Atsugewi, of their mourning
he states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The deceased&rsquo;s close relatives mourned the hardest, but
friends might also mourn&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;to make them feel better.&rsquo;
Mourners cried and rolled on the ground, throwing dirt and hot
ashes in their faces and hair. Some, in their grief, tried to
commit suicide, and a close watch had to be kept over them
to prevent their doing so. Favorite methods were to swallow
small bits of (obsidian) or to eat a certain kind of spider.
Mourners were warned not to cry around the house near the
body but to go to the hills to cry, and also not to look down
when crying or to cry too much. Otherwise they were subject
to bad dreams in which spirits would plague them and possibly
kill them. A mourner might acquire power at this time. A
widow, with possibly a sister to help her, would wail for a
time at daybreak and again in the evening. This lasted for
two or three months, sometimes longer. A widower seldom
cried more than two or three weeks. The widow visited places
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
at which she had camped with her husband, broke up utensils
left there, burned down the brush where he was accustomed
to cut wood, and piled up rocks where they had slept together.
A widower behaved in similar fashion.... If death occurred in
a village, no entertainments could be held for a time; otherwise
relatives of the deceased had the right to break things
up and throw them around. A man would not sing or attend a
&lsquo;big time&rsquo; gathering until at least a year after death of a close
relative.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the lodge were to be lived in again, after a person had died
in it, Atsugewi brought in juniper boughs, and these were burned
to purify the house. Bark huts, however, were always burned down
after an occupant had died.</p>
<p>Mountain Maidu children were kept away from the dead and from
the funeral proceedings. In that tribe and probably among all local
tribes, if the deceased were rich the funeral would be much larger
and more pretentious than if the person had been poor. In the
former case the ceremony was followed by a feast. Other tribes
buried the dead in the evening generally within twenty-four hours
after death, but Yana waited three or four days. Mountain Maidu
grave diggers put grass in their mouths. Small shallow graves
sufficed for poor people, in fact, among Atsugewi, at least, poor
people were often buried in small depressions in lava flows and
covered over with convenient rocks.</p>
<p>Enroute to Atsugewi burials no one was permitted to look back,
and water was sprinkled along the path to prevent the dead person&rsquo;s
spirit from returning to the village. At the grave the dead were
asked aloud please not to look back, for if they did other members
of their families would die soon.</p>
<p>Cremation, that is, burning of corpses was rare among tribes of
the Lassen area. At the battlefield and in other instances of death
far from home, especially in the case of mountain Maidu, burning
was done occasionally. After this the bones were collected,
wrapped in buckskin, and then buried.</p>
<p>The flexed bodies of the dead were always placed in graves
facing eastward. Widows customarily attempted to throw themselves
into the graves, but were restrained from doing so. A basket
of water was invariably placed next to the body, and most personal
property of the deceased was broken and also placed in the grave.
The amount of property so disposed of varied with the tribe.
Mountain Maidu and especially the Yana tribes put practically everything
in the grave. The latter even went so far as to include many
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
gifts of a nature not normally associated with the sex. Aprons and
baskets, for instance, might be placed in a man&rsquo;s burial. Among
Atsugewi the relatives retained some of the property of the deceased.
Atsugewi might place some food on the grave and mark it with a
vertical stick, but it was not tended later, and the site was generally
soon lost.</p>
<p>In winter a person might be buried shallowly in the floor of a
living house. Next spring the house would be torn down and the
dirt walls caved in. There was variation not only between, but
within tribes as to the final disposition of houses of the deceased.
They might be burned down, a common practice, or they were torn
down, abandoned, temporarily deserted, or torn down and rebuilt.
If to be lived in again, purification of some sort was always
practiced, either by burning juniper boughs in the house, smoking
tobacco, bringing in aromatic plants, or treating the main beams.
Among Yana tribes the family seems to have habitually abandoned
the house right after the funeral and to have burned the whole thing
including property and food of all the inmates, retaining only the
barest necessities of life such as sleeping robes.</p>
<p>Among Atsugewi all mourners had to deny themselves meat and
fresh fish for one day; then they sweated and swam after the funeral.
Mountain Maidu mourners, including all persons who had had any
part in the funeral, had to undergo four or five days taboo on eating
all flesh. They also had to eat alone and from separate dishes,
do head scratching with special sticks only, were allowed no hunting,
gambling, intercourse, or smoking. Purification of those
persons contaminated by participation in burial included swimming
and washing every day that the taboos were in effect.</p>
<p>Only Atsugewi, of all local tribes, are said to have practiced
suicide, though unquestionably it did occur on occasion among all
California Indians.</p>
<p>Mentioning the name of the deceased in the presence of his
relatives was considered very poor taste, and was actually forbidden
in some cases.</p>
<p>It was forbidden that the widow touch the corpse, so that relatives
had to prepare the body for burial. After the funeral, the
widow always cut her hair off closely. If an Atsugewi, she made
a belt out of it, and the hair belt was then often decorated with
shells. In all local tribes the widow traditionally covered her
whole head and face with pitch and covered this with white diatomaceous
earth or black charcoal. Touching her head or face (the
whole body for mountain Maidu) with fingers was taboo; she could
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
do this only with the scratching stick which mountain Maidu widows
wore around the neck. Raggedy, ill-looking clothes were worn by
the survivor, and Atsugewi widows put pitch on old basketry caps
to be worn. A mourning necklace was worn at all times, made of
lumps of hard pitch strung onto a fiber string. This was worn until
remarriage, which was usually two or three years for Atsugewi and
one to three years for mountain Maidu. Pitch on the face and head
was normally left on until it wore off of its own accord.</p>
<p>The mourning conduct of grieving men who had lost their wives
in death was not nearly so lengthy or as rigorous as was that of
widows. Widowers cut their hair too, but among Atsugewi the only
other observance required was abstinence of flesh eating for a day.
Mountain Maidu widowers spent one sleepless night out in the
mountains. Widowers did not generally sing at dances and at &ldquo;big
times&rdquo; for about a year, but this was not compulsory. The Yana
are said to have stayed away from dances for two or three years.</p>
<p>Parents mourning the loss of children cut their hair slightly and
placed some pitch on hair or faces. The Atsugewi mother observed
a three day meat taboo and the Maidu father went to the hills to
seek power. However, loss of a baby in birth or before its navel
cord dropped off was considered a more serious situation. Such
bereaved parents gave all of their belongings away in order to make
a fresh start.</p>
<p>Anniversary mourning rites were not conducted in the Lassen
region. An exception was the rare instance among Atsugewi when
a child was sick at a time just three years after the death of its
parent. Under such circumstances a shaman sang over the child
and the whole remaining family and relatives mourned, later washing
themselves. With respect to the general lack of mourning anniversaries
it is of interest that the foothill (northeast) Maidu held
elaborate annual burnings for several years after death of relatives.
At these great mourning dance ceremonies large quantities of
valuable possessions were burned as sacrifices to honor the dead.</p>

<h2 id="c31"><span class="small">Chapter XXIX</span>
<br />COUNTING, TIME, AND PLACE</h2>
<p>Counting on the fingers was usual practice. Mountain Maidu
started with their thumbs while Atsugewi began on the little finger
of one hand and counted across to that on the other hand, and toes
were used for the purpose too. To help in counting, tribes also
employed sticks to represent groups of numbers: Atsugewi used
sticks to represent 1&rsquo;s, 5&rsquo;s, 10&rsquo;s, and hundreds. Yana frequently
used a stick to represent the unit 20. This is presumed to be a
natural unit because it is the sum of all of a person&rsquo;s fingers and
toes.</p>
<p>Time of day, of course, was not expressed in any unit like our
hour, but roughly by the position of the sun in its daily course overhead.
Seven to nine positions were referred to descriptively in this
respect plus early, mid, and late night.</p>
<p>Phases of the moon were most practical and were universally
used as a longer measure of time. The succession of new moon
cycles were named and an old man in the village customarily kept
track of these by memory. As might be expected from this system,
in which there was no recording, arguments ensued over just which
moon or &ldquo;month&rdquo; was currently in effect. One full course of the
moon&rsquo;s phases takes just about a month, so the names for Indians&rsquo;
moons corresponded nearly to our month names.</p>
<p>All local tribes recognized four seasons. These were identified
by the positions of certain stars among mountain Maidu, but more
generally by the positions of the rising sun with respect to a certain
peak, tree, or similar fixed object. Some Indians kept track of the
seasons by watching the daily progression of a beam of sunlight
coming through the smoke hole of a house and falling upon its floor
or wall. The shortest day of the year naturally was marked by the
most southerly progression of the sun. This was noted by the
Indians, no doubt with joy in the realization that longer days and,
somewhat later, warmer weather were to be expected. The year
started with the beginning of November when Indians of the Lassen
area had left the high elevation hunting grounds on the flanks of
Lassen Peak, had collected their stores of acorn and salmon, and
were warmly settled in their winter quarters. Mountain Maidu seem
to have used names for only the nine moons most important to them.</p>
<p>There was no calendar as such, but the number of days until a
certain &ldquo;big time&rdquo; or other event was kept track of by either cutting
off or untying one knot in a knotted cord or thong each day. Years
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
were not recorded either, but were measured within the memory span
as so many winters ago, or by relating time to some important event,
such as a war which most persons might remember.</p>
<p>Directions were pointed out, or in speech were referred to as
sunrise and sunset for east and west respectively. Directions were
commonly given with respect to features of the local geography: in
the direction of such and such a village or toward a named river,
spring, or mountain which was conspicuous or generally known.
We must remember that the territories of our local tribes were small
and that the terrain was intimately known. Specific names were not
only given to the conspicuous features of the topography, but among
Atsugewi, at least, virtually every flat, every draw, and every hill
was specifically named, and these names were known to all members
of the tribe. Names of places in the territories of other tribes were
not known by the local names of those tribes. They were either
translated or given its own entirely different set of names by the
first tribe. In other words, each tribe had different names for all
places&mdash;a very confusing situation. Dixon reports that Maidu
recognized directions as we know them, but that the northeast or
mountain Maidu had five: west, northwest (the direction of Lassen
Peak), north, east, and south.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<h2 id="c32"><span class="small">Chapter XXX</span>
<br />CONCEPTS OF SUN, MOON, AND STARS</h2>
<p>Mountain Maidu and Atsugewi believed the sun to be a female
human&mdash;the wife&mdash;and the moon to be a male human&mdash;the
husband. This is a reversal of the sex ascribed to these bodies by
some other tribes. They believed that the figure of a frog was
visible in the moon.</p>
<p>Atsugewi stated that Frog fought Moon and swallowed him and
the next time that Moon swallowed Frog who is now in the center
of the moon. When Moon and Frog fought, the former was not round,
but crescent shaped. Yana stated that in the moon they could see
Moon&rsquo;s wife, Frog. Pine Marten snapped his evil father-in-law
Moon into the sky by means of bending a springy tree &rsquo;way down
and suddenly letting it go. He used the same system to snap Frog
and her two daughters into the sky also.</p>
<p>To Atsugewi, as to most tribes, the phases of the moon: new,
full, and waning, represented birth, life, and death&mdash;repeated
every four weeks, although, of course, none of the Indians had the
concept of a &ldquo;week&rdquo; such as we have. All through the year
Atsugewi greeted the new moon. Old persons shook themselves,
and their clothes and bedding in its presence. Younger folks ran
and jumped toward the moon. If the points or horns of the new moon
crescent were vertical it was a bad omen indicating sickness or
death. Babies were shown the new moon, and in the case of both
Atsugewi and mountain Maidu, babies&rsquo; faces and arms were rubbed
in the new moonlight to make them grow fast. All local tribes
addressed the moon aloud in friendly terms as if it were a personal
relative. The Yana prayed to it. In contrast to Atsugewi reaction
to vertical position of the two moon points, the Yana and mountain
Maidu accepted this as meaning good fortune and good weather
ahead. To these tribes horizontal position of the moon crescent in
the winter sky denoted that it was full of water and indicated pending
rains or storms. At other seasons both horns up foretold of
death. Yana thought that both sun and moon were feminine.</p>
<p>After its daily trip across the sky, Atsugewi thought that the
sun returned to the east in a blue cloud via the side of the earth.
As the sun and the moon passed each other at the side of the earth,
they decided on the weather for the following day. The moon
supplied the cold and the sun the heat.</p>
<p>Eclipses of sun and moon were believed by Yana to be due to
their dogs devouring them. Atsugewi and mountain Maidu felt that
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
the heavenly bodies were dying. The former were of the opinion
that Lizard was eating Sun or Moon as the case might be. They
shouted loudly, shot arrows into the air toward the eclipse and beat
all available female dogs. Mountain Maidu thought that Frog was
eating Moon or Sun.</p>
<p>A reddish moon foretold of disaster and was a sign of war for
Atsugewi, but to Yana it meant hot weather ahead.</p>
<p>Only a few star groups of the night sky were named.</p>
<p>Yana thought the constellation we call the Belt of Orion was
Coyote&rsquo;s arrow. All local tribes believed the Milky Way to be a
road, or river in some cases, which was traveled by departing spirits
or souls of the dead. Shooting or Falling stars, (more properly
meteorites) presaged good weather to the Atsugewi who thought
these were torches carried by spirits from one house to another in
the sky. For this tribe too, a single conspicuous star&mdash;no doubt
a planet&mdash;seen near the moon was an evil sign. If the star were
on the left someone nearby would die soon; if it lay to the right of
the moon someone farther away was doomed.</p>
<p>Atsugewi called the Seven Sisters wir-etisu. These girls were
seduced by a little rabbit boy at a puberty dance. They became
ashamed and went up in the sky to become stars. The Big Dipper
was called Coyote&rsquo;s Cane. Maidu thought that stars were made of
something soft like buckskin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<h2 id="c33"><span class="small">Chapter XXXI</span>
<br />WEATHER PHENOMENA</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the preceding chapter, weather was determined
by agreement between sun and moon, but it appears that many things
could influence their decisions.</p>
<p>Atsugewi assumed it to be the natural thing that it would sprinkle
a little after a funeral. They also felt that rolling rocks down
mountain sides or loud shouting in the mountains would cause rain.
Furthermore they believed that the occurrence of precipitation could
be influenced by shamans, if they felt like it, by smoking tobacco
while looking at the sun. The nature of the spirit of a girl, whose
ears were pierced at this time, was also thought to either cause
it to rain or to stop doing so according to her spirit power.</p>
<p>Rainbows brought good wild crops as far as the Atsugewi were
concerned. However, both they and mountain Maidu were of the
opinion that pointing with a finger at a rainbow, particularly among
children would cause the finger to become crooked or to fall off.</p>
<p>Thunder and lightning were feared by all tribes of the Lassen
region. To Atsugewi thunder was the shouting of an old man who
wears a rabbit skin and who goes about looking for women whom
he kills. Mountain Maidu thought it to be due to an old man who
lives up above and who was once a boy on earth, but who had been
sent away because he was too fast and ate everything in sight.
How he made the noise we do not know.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, according to Dixon, &ldquo;Thunder is thought to be a man
or boy of miraculous abilities. He eats trees chiefly. Had it
not been for Mosquito, however, Thunder would have preyed on
people. Mosquito deceived him, and refused to let Thunder
know whence the blood and meat he brought came. Had Thunder
found out that Mosquito obtained these from people, they, and
not the trees, would have been his prey.&rdquo; To Yana, thunder
was a mythical dog originally: &ldquo;... a child dug from the
ground who accompanied Flint Boy to the west in the guise of
a dog. He remained behind in the black storm clouds capping
Bally Mountain, a high peak west of Redding, whence his
terrific bark could be heard as thunder.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Atsugewi and mountain Maidu, fearing thunder and lightning,
talked to them and told them to go away. Old men in the latter tribe
carried burning sticks in a circle to help drive them away. Atsugewi
placed skins, preferably raccoon, on sticks held up in the air. They
would wave these around and call aloud words to the effect that
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
there are: &ldquo;Too many rattlesnakes here, go some other place!&rdquo;.
Not only that, but frequently during a thunder storm, especially if
violent, they would run into open areas, and sometimes even jump
into water. Lightning was thought to be the weapon of the old man,
Thunder Person, mentioned above. It came out of his mouth. Apparently
Thunder Person was thought to assume the form of a
raccoon on occasion. Maidu also believed that it would thunder
whenever a person was bitten by a rattlesnake or when a great man
died or when a woman had a miscarriage.</p>
<p>Whirlwinds were generally regarded as evil omens which sickened
people with bad dreams and captured peoples&rsquo; shadows or spirits.
Indians tried to dodge or hide from them. They spoke informally to
whirlwinds. Mountain Maidu said that they put pains into people.
Whenever possible, Maidu smoked tobacco when talking to whirlwinds.
Atsugewi threw dirt and water at the dust devils in an effort
to destroy them. Yana did likewise, but they did not believe that
spirits were inside of whirlwinds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<h2 id="c34"><span class="small">Chapter XXXII</span>
<br />EARTHQUAKE BELIEFS</h2>
<p>Lassen Peak and its vicinity are subject to many local earthquakes
today. The geologic nature of the area indicates that this
has been so for thousands of years. Lassen Peak was known to
the Atsugewi as Wicuhirdiki, which has no meaning. The area was
thought to be inhabited by a powerful spirit, but Garth notes that
there seemed to be no fear about hunting and fishing there, and the
Indians apparently utilized the hot springs medicinally. Garth
recorded one pertinent bit of Atsugewi (Apwaruge) myth as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There once was an earthquake that shook this country
up and made those boulders out on the flat shake. It shook
so much that it made people sick. There was a very old
woman whose hair was almost green. She picked up a rock
and pounded it on another rock while she sang. She was
praying for the world to stop shaking. Soon she got an
answer, and the shaking ceased. Many people were killed.
Those who lived in canyons were covered by rocks that were
shaken down.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yana interpretation of the perplexing and frightening phenomenon
of earthquakes is tied in, as we might expect, with mythology as
follows, to quote from Sapir and Spier:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A series of fabulous malignant beings were conceived
as dwelling in certain localities. In the Sacramento River
were water grizzlies (hat-en-na) which pulled fishermen
down to devour (them).... They were spotted black and
white, like dogs. Somewhere (not specified) was a serpent
(e-k-u) which killed people. Near Terry&rsquo;s mill were believed
to dwell malignant little beings (yo-yautsgi), like little
children. They often enticed people and ate them up. At a
marshy spot and spring on Round Mountain, called Ha-mupdi
(?), dwelled a being called Mo-s-ugi-yauna who
caused the ground to shake when he was displeased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once Mo-s-ugi-yauna made a little baby of himself
and put himself in the road of two women. One of them took
it up and in sport gave it one of her nipples to suck, though
she was really without milk. The baby kept sucking until
the girl tried to take her breast away, but without success.
The baby kept sucking at her, sucked up her flesh, and at
last sucked up her whole body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This being was displeased if strangers came near and
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
talked anything but Yana. Once some Yreka Indians came
and talked Chinook jargon at that place, whereupon the earth
began to shake violently. At last the owner of the place
cried out to Mo-s-ugi-yauna that it was not he who had thus
spoken and begged him &lsquo;in the doctor way&rsquo; to stop, whereupon
he did.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<h2 id="c35"><span class="small">Chapter XXXIII</span>
<br />CREATION BELIEFS AND OTHER LEGENDS</h2>
<p>All local Indians believed in a mythical age when animals were
persons and talked to each other. Both Atsugewi and mountain
Maidu thought that floods played a part in the past scheme of things
before people were created by gifted animal ancestors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Garth relates that &ldquo;Atsugewi mythology tells of the successive
creation of two former worlds, the first of which was
destroyed by a great flood and the second by a fire which
Coyote instigated in an attempt to kill his rival, Grey Fox.
After this both Coyote and Grey Fox descended from the
heavens on a long rope to the primeval sea below. Here
Grey Fox took combings from his fur (in some accounts a
piece of sod) and proceeded to make land of it, stretching
it to all sides until the present earth was made, in concept
a large island floating in the sea. Grey Fox then created
trees, animals, and finally people. The sun and moon were
two brothers whom Grey Fox told to mount into the sky to
light the world, the one during the day and the other at
night.... Grey Fox first wanted to create two moons and
two suns, but Coyote objected saying that it would be too
hot. Grey Fox then made only the sun and one moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a somewhat different version, Dixon has recorded that
the Atsugewi &ldquo;... recount how, in the beginning, there was
only the illimitable sea and the cloudless sky. Slowly in the
sky a tiny cloud began to form, and grew till it reached considerable
proportions. Then gradually it condensed, and,
becoming solid, became the Silver-Gray Fox, the Creator.
Then arose immediately a fog; and from this, as it condensed,
and coagulated as it were, arose Coyote. By a process of
long-continued and intense thought, the Creator created a
canoe into which both he and Coyote descended, and for long
years floated and drifted aimlessly therein, till, the canoe
having become moss-grown and decayed, they had, perforce, to
consider the necessity of creating a world whereon they
might take refuge.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Yana legends quoted below from Gifford and Klimek (first)
and from Sapir and Spier are from the northern and central tribes,
of that people. These legends are given in lieu of those of southern
Yana and Yahi, with which this book should be concerned, because
of the similarity of the culture of these four tribes. It is extremely
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
unlikely that there would be very great differences in their legends
and beliefs of creation. Obviously each tribe had its own unique
details.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>North Yana: &ldquo;Coyote, assistant creator, was marplot (the
evil schemer) who brought death into the world as follows:
Coyote, his two sons, and other people went down-stream
to get clamshells. The people played. Coyote&rsquo;s sons seized
the clamshells and ran off with them. One escaped with the
stolen shells, but the other was killed. The Coyote boy who
escaped shouted to Old Man Coyote, who sat in his assembly
house and observed daily what transpired. Coyote boy told
the old man his brother was dead. Old Coyote then mourned
for his son. Silver Fox told him not to cry, but to clean the
assembly house and bring in the dead boy. They strewed the
floor with straw and built fire. Silver Fox told old Coyote to
lie down and pretend to sleep. &lsquo;Do not move,&rsquo; said Silver
Fox. This was to cause dead boy to revive. They started to
cut old Coyote&rsquo;s belly to get back the spirit of his dead son.
Old Coyote shouted with pain and said: &lsquo;Let him stay dead.
The dead shall remain dead.&rsquo; Thus he spoiled Silver Fox&rsquo;s
plan for resurrection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Central Yana: &ldquo;... the creation of people took place at
Wama-riwi, a village at the cove north of Battle Creek and
several miles west of the present Shingletown, that is,
roughly at the center of Yana territory. Here in the beginning
were Lizard and Cottontail (in Dixon&rsquo;s version, Lizard, Gray
Squirrel, and Coyote; in Curtin&rsquo;s, Silkworm) who had no
predecessors. Discussing how people shall be made, Lizard
lays down sticks which they carry to the four directions to
become neighboring Indian tribes. Realizing that they have
omitted those at the center, they put down bad (short) sticks
there. Hence the Yana are shorter than any of their neighbors:
a view held by the Yana and repeated by Powers as fact.
In Dixon&rsquo;s version (from the same informant) Lizard carefully
prepares three sticks for Atsugewi, Wintun, and
Achomawi, and as an afterthought, short sticks for the Yana.
The first three are placed to the east, west, and north; the
others are boiled to transform them into humans. Coyote
refuses to recognize them until they speak properly, that is,
the Yana tongue. Curtin&rsquo;s version is quite different, although
still the Yana are created from sticks: his presumably Northern
Yana informant, himself a chief, placed the locale in his
own country, at Round Mountain. Here Silkworm puts down
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
three sticks, for the Yana chief, a woman, and an orphan,
and a large number around the first for common people; he
instructs them how to procure food and admonishes that they
obey the chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The origin of sex, or rather its proper attribution rests
in the circumstance that in the beginning, women were men;
men were women. The women were such poor hunters that
people starved. To remedy this, Cottontail placed stones in
a fire; when the women were seated, the stones burst, cutting
their proper organs, and the women became men. Hands
were then webbed like Lizard&rsquo;s. In order that they might
handle bows and pestles, Lizard, experimenting, cut his
fingers apart. With this as a model, he separated those of
humans. (In Curtin&rsquo;s version, Water Lizard remedies the
defect for himself alone.) In the beginning when people
died, they rose from their graves again. Coyote, who objected
to these improvements of human affairs, not only proposes
that they shall stay dead but stamps down a dead man who
would rise. When his own son dies, he changes his mind, but
Lizard, Cottontail, and Gray Squirrel will have none of it,
so that death and mourning were established forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Garth is here quoted on Atsugewi beliefs: &ldquo;As in
most of northern California there are numerous natural
phenomena in Atsugewi territory which marked some mythological
event. A low cone-like rock in Dixie Valley was
said to be a basket belonging to Coyote. About four miles
south of Pittville on the old village site of Mawakasui was
an oblong rock ten feet or so in length which was said to be
the petrified remains of a lizard whom Butterfly had killed.
The extremely rough tongue of lava-covered land extending
down the center of Hat Creek Valley was created by Porcupine
to impede Coyote with whom Porcupine was running a
race. Eagle Lake was said to have been formerly in Atsuge
territory, but Coyote tired of the manzanita berries and
camass roots which the people fed to him here, so he moved
the lake to the Apwaruge country. Here the people fed him
epos roots and treated him better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Maidu concept of the world according to Dixon is that
of &ldquo;... floating on the surface of a great sea, but anchored
by five ropes stretched by the Creator, which hold the island
steady, and prevent it from drifting about. Occasionally some
being seizes these ropes and shakes them, and this causes
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
earthquakes. The world was flat when first made from the
bit of mud brought up from the depths of the primeval sea by
the turtle (turtle does not appear in the northeast or mountain
Maidu version) or from the robin&rsquo;s nest floating in the sea.
Later the Creator and the Coyote went about over the world,
making the rivers and mountains. Coyote was in general
responsible for the latter, and for the extreme roughness of
the country....&rdquo; The Creator&rsquo;s stone canoe is said to be
visible today on top of Keddie Peak just north of Indian
Valley (Greenville); also his and Coyote&rsquo;s dance houses
may be seen as huge circular depressions at what is now
Durham (near Chico).</p>
<p>In his extensive collection of Maidu myths, Dixon observes
that &ldquo;Throughout the myths there is nowhere any
suggestion that the Maidu had any knowledge of any other
region, that they were immigrants in the land where they
live. This complete absence of any migration tradition is a
feature which is very characteristic, and serves to differentiate
the mythology not only of the Maidu, but of most
Californian tribes, from that of the Southwest, and much of
the eastern portion of the continent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He further states: &ldquo;here the creation is a real beginning:
beyond it, there is nothing. In the beginning was only the
great sea, calm and unlimited, to which, down from the clear
sky, the Creator came, or on which he and Coyote were floating
in a canoe. Of the origin of previous place of abode of
either Creator or Coyote, the Maidu know nothing....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;... the whole series of tales told by the stock ...
appeared to follow one another in a more or less regular and
recognized order. Beginning with the creation, a rather
systematic chain of events leads up to the appearance of the
ancestors of the present Indians, with whose coming the
mythic cycle came to a close. This mythic era, the be-be-ito,
seems to fall into a number of periods, with each of
which a group or set of myths has to deal. First, we have
the coming of Ko-do-yan-pe (Earth-Namer or Creator) and
Coyote, their discovery of this world, and the preparation of
it for the &lsquo;first people&rsquo;; next the creation of these first
people, and the making and planting of the germs of the
human race, the Indians, who were to come after; third, the
long period during which the first people were in conflict,
and were in the end changed to the various animals in the
present world. In this period Earth-Maker tries to put an
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
end to Coyote, whose evil ways and wishes are in direct
contrast to his own.&rdquo; Creator was always dignified and striving
to make life easy, happy, and deathless for mankind,
while Coyote, a trickster and amorous knave, worked with
continued success to render life difficult for man with the
result that man&rsquo;s lot is to suffer and finally to die. This
belief was generally uniform among the tribes of the Lassen
area. &ldquo;... During this period Earth-Maker strives for a
last time in vain with Coyote, his defeat, and disappearance
toward the East coincident with the appearance of the human
race, which bursts forth from the spots where the original
pairs had been buried long before.&rdquo; These potential human
beings had been made &ldquo;... as tiny wooden figures by the
Creator, and planted here and there in pairs, that they might
grow in secret and safety during the time of monsters and
great conflicts....&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other myths also there is great similarity among the
Maidu, Atsugewi, Yana, and Yahi. Dixon says concerning
&ldquo;... The theft of fire, for instance.... In all, the fire
is held by a man and his daughters, and is discovered largely
through the agency of the Lizard; the fire is watched and
guarded by a sentinel bird, is stolen in consequence of his
sleeping while on guard, and pursuit by the women is hindered
by the strings of their skirts being cut as they sleep.
The fire is brought back by a group of animals, among whom
the fire is divided for safety; and the pursuers, who are
usually Thunder, and his two daughters Rain and Hail, are
put to flight.&rdquo;</p>

<br />MEDICAL TREATMENT</h2>
<p>The bulk of the important doctoring was done by shamans or
medicine men. This was all based on supernatural faith and fear.
As we know from advances of our modern civilization in the field
of psychosomatic medicine, such &ldquo;in the mind&rdquo; cures were highly
effective in practice. With all due respect to the modern medical
profession, it is a foregone conclusion that from 50% to 75% of the
patients of today&rsquo;s general medical doctor are going to get well
eventually without any bonafide medical treatment anyway. This
percentage favored the shamans too.</p>
<p>Besides shamans there were secondary Indian doctors called
herbalists. Among Atsugewi, these persons did not have the power
of shamans, and could not cure disease, but only check or weaken
it. However, this class of doctor did administer various medicines
internally and externally, and gave treatments which may actually
have been&mdash;in some cases&mdash;of benefit beyond mere faith healing.
These remedies were handed down, as was all Indian
knowledge, by word of mouth from generation to generation. Old
men taught the young.</p>
<p>Herbalists were able to make snake bite victims recover; treatment
included sucking the wound. Cauterization or burning of
affected parts was practiced. Atsugewi treated rheumatism in
patients with vapor baths in a trench of hot coals on which pine
needles and yerba santa or mountain balm branches were placed,
with a robe over all.</p>
<p>Mountain Maidu smoked wild parsnip for headaches, colds, and
wounds. Mountain Maidu and Atsugewi believed that toothaches
were caused by the presence of worms in the teeth. Corrective
poultices were placed on the cheek. Yana did this too, but placed
a hot stone on the poultice, and also bit on a mole&rsquo;s front foot,
dried, to relieve the pain. Atsugewi often set the poultice on fire
which might leave permanent scars.</p>
<p>The seeds of rosinweed, a member of the sunflower family, were
collected, then shelled, cooked, dried, and finally pounded. This
medicine was taken for chills. Wild iris roots were chewed raw for
coughing.</p>
<p>Decoctions, that is, water in which plants had been boiled to
extract their medicinal juices, were drunk. California angelica, a
member of the parsley family, was used in this way for colds, diarrhea,
headache, et cetera. This medication was popular with all
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
local tribes for treating many ills.</p>
<p>Yana used poultices of roots of bracken fern, pounded and warmed
for application to burns. The bulbs of false solomon seal were
pounded fine and also hot soap-root poultices were applied to
swellings, pains, or boils. Peeled California angelica roots were
crushed and laid on aching heads.</p>
<p>Ground squirrel grease was used to soften rough hands and to
relieve cracking of the skin from chapping.</p>
<p>Atsugewi employed green leaves of chokecherry, pounded as
poultices, for cuts, sores, and bruises. The boiled liquor of pounded
chokecherry bark was used for bathing wounds to promote healing.</p>
<p>They employed decoctions of wormwood to prevent blood poisoning
and to treat cuts. Decoctions of greenleaf manzanita leaves
were good for cuts and burns. Both oak bark and oak gall decoctions
were drunk to prevent infection and catching colds and
were given to women in childbirth. Atsugewi also chewed raw
juniper berries as a treatment for colds.</p>
<p>Obviously there was a host of other treatments as we know of
a large variety of other plants, roots, and fruits which were used
medicinally.</p>
<p>Broken bones were set as best they could be set, and were
bound up in simple but effective splints.</p>
<p>For general good health Garth states that an Atsugewi &ldquo;...
man chewed the top shoot off a young pine tree. Especially was
this done by a father after his wife bore a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Yana sweat houses and probably in those of other tribes too,
veins were cut with obsidian chips to &ldquo;let the bad blood out&rdquo; if
a person felt ill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<h2 id="c37"><span class="small">Chapter XXXV</span>
<br />SPIRITS AND GHOSTS</h2>
<p>Ghosts and spirits were one and the same, and were to local
Indians as souls are conceived by white man, yet the Indian conception
was more variable. Some spirits were good and others were
evil, but all were feared and avoided whenever possible. They
were frequently associated with omens and had somewhat the
appearance of human beings. Among Atsugewi they were visible
only to shamans, but were heard by nearly all persons. Yana commoners
both saw and heard spirits, but only very rarely.</p>
<p>The spirit left the body right after death. Mountain Maidu thought
that it turned back once before going on. Yana believed that the
spirit tarried in the vicinity of the body for a while, going to the
south first briefly for a sort of trial or evaluation which included
determination as to whether or not the nose septum had been
pierced. Then, as all local Indians apparently agreed, the ghost or
spirit went to a distant place in the west via the Milky Way. Yana
thought that there was some distinction in destination of good and
bad persons&rsquo; ghosts, but our other tribes conceived only of one
place for all spirits finally. We do not today have a very clear
understanding of the aboriginal Indian concept of heaven except
that people lived in this land of the dead in sweat houses, hunting,
eating, loving, and sleeping, but with complete absence of sickness.
Concepts of the life of spirits changed with the coming of
the whites preceding even the advent of pioneer settler days. All
information in that regard which students have been able to gain
from informants in this region is decidedly flavored with Christian
dogma.</p>
<p>Spirits or ghosts returned to old haunts of the body on occasion
or, more often, to the vicinity of the grave. For this reason burial
grounds were usually well removed from villages. Bad smells
would drive spirits away, while whistling and flowers attracted
them. Fiber-wound crossed sticks were hung in sweat houses of
Yana tribes to keep spirits out. All tribes of the Lassen area
thought that ghosts visited the living in dreams and also considered
it feasible that the spirits of people might go to visit those of the
dead when the persons were asleep, or more commonly when the
living were unconscious.</p>
<p>Mountain Maidu didn&rsquo;t speak much about ghosts, but if one had
been making a nuisance of itself by visiting much in dreams, they
fed it by having all members of the family throw small portions of
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
food into the fire before commencing to eat their meals. Besides,
a shaman was hired under these circumstances to sing for the
dreamer. The same ceremony was observed by the Atsugewi. It
was also the practice of the dreamer in this tribe to eat with a dog,
spitting out some of the food, saying to the dog, &ldquo;You better eat
for me. Take that spirit away.&rdquo; Atsugewi were evidently very
conscious of ghosts for they spoke to them, spit out chewed epos
roots for the spirits, smoked tobacco for them, burned hair and skin
to repel them, and tobacco and feather bundles were hung near the
house doorways for their benefit. New Atsugewi parents had a
unique ritual at the time of their first meat eating after the taboos
of childbirth&mdash;they chewed small amounts of meat and put this on
their toes for the dogs to eat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Garth says of Atsugewi spirit beliefs: &ldquo;A man who was
about to die, whether he felt sick or not, had a peculiar
odor about him. If he went hunting, deer ran from him saying,
&lsquo;Phew, that man smells bad.&rsquo; Coyotes and dogs would
come close to him and bark at him. He would die unless a
shaman could remove this aura of death from him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were many omens of a spirit nature which foretold calamity.
To Atsugewi upon hearing the cries of certain animals at night,
especially if an owl hooted at one, or if one saw a kingsnake, death
was supposed to descend upon a relative.</p>
<p>If evil spirits frightened a person and tried to steal his soul,
the spirits could be foiled by standing with one&rsquo;s feet widely spread
apart. If followed by a ghost, a person might turn around, retracing
his footsteps while the spirit continued in the direction one had
been traveling initially.</p>
<p>When a person was asleep his spirit could wander around. If,
during these wanderings, a bad spirit caught the person&rsquo;s spirit
before he could awaken, the person was deprived of it.</p>
<p>Also the spirit on occasion left a person voluntarily if it didn&rsquo;t
like the body, as for instance, if it smelled badly. When a person&rsquo;s
spirit or soul were gone, only the heart was left to keep him alive,
and he would succumb easily to the first sickness. For this reason,
Atsugewi shamans periodically examined all the people to see if
any spirits were missing. When anyone was found lacking his spirit,
the shaman had to work to bring it back, sucking it into the person&rsquo;s
head. If several spirits were missing at once, it was not easy to
get the right spirit back into its own body. They didn&rsquo;t know what
would happen if a person got the wrong soul back into his body&mdash;but
it wasn&rsquo;t good.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<h2 id="c38"><span class="small">Chapter XXXVI</span>
<br />SHAMANISM AND DOCTORING</h2>
<p>Shamans or doctors, more commonly known to modern Americans
by the name medicine men, were important in the lives of all Indians
but, among ours, probably to the highest degree among the Maidu.
Whether we, with our scientific enlightenment today, are after all
happier and of greater peace of mind, than the aborigines were or
not, is a philosophical consideration beyond the scope of this book.
The fact of the matter is that mankind in the past invariably has
resorted to the supernatural to explain things not understood.
Indians are a case in point&mdash;being totally without scientific explanations,
mysticism and the supernatural pervaded their whole
culture&mdash;their every day activities&mdash;to a point which to us today
seems fantastic, yet understandable in a way. If you and I had been
in the Indian&rsquo;s place, might not we also have subscribed whole
heartedly to these same beliefs with which we would have grown up,
and which our loved and trusted elders had taught us in good faith?
Shamanism gave to the Indians a feeling of comfort and, shall we
say, security?&mdash;a sort of foundation of faith which all men must
have for the living of reasonably satisfying lives.</p>
<p>Shamans were men of influence in the village, with prestige
second only to that of the chief. Women shamans were uncommon
and usually possessed less potent power. The life of a shaman
was precarious because if he failed to effect a high percentage of
cures or if he were &ldquo;proven&rdquo; responsible for sending pains which
caused death to persons, he might be killed&mdash;sometimes even with
the advance approval of the chief, and without retaliation by the
offending shaman&rsquo;s relatives. When this was done, he was cut into
pieces, not for the morbid reasons, the reader might suspect, but
for the practical reason that the parts of his body could in this way
be disposed of in widely scattered places. Otherwise there was the
danger that he might, with the help of his power, be reassembled
and again be able to continue his malpractice and to include his
murderers among future victims.</p>
<p>There were several kinds of shamans among the local Indians.
Each tribe in the Lassen area had the all important Sucking Shaman.
Atsugewi and mountain Maidu also had special Bear, Rattlesnake,
and Weather Shamans while only Yana had Singing Shamans in
addition.</p>
<p>The power of shamans was much more potent than mere &ldquo;luck&rdquo;
which came easily to the majority of ordinary mortals in dreams,
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
during puberty ceremonies, and the like. This &ldquo;luck&rdquo; was a weak
supernatural blessing which was not sought, but came voluntarily
and gave the person skill and success in crafts and daily pursuits
such as fishing, hunting certain animals or birds, canoe making,
et cetera.</p>
<p>It would be impractical in this book to give the complicated and
voluminous details of all phases of shamanism as conceived and
practiced by each of the four local tribes. The following information
has been somewhat generalized in the hope that the reader will get
the &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of the shaman concept which was essentially the same
for all the tribes of the Lassen area.</p>
<p>Power was usually sought by men desiring to be shamans, but
all were not successful in such quests. On the other hand shamanistic
power came to some voluntarily, and it was dangerous not to
accept this power if it came to one. To refuse might cause death.
One could tell when one was successful in getting power because
one would bleed from the nose or mouth. He would also learn to
sing and dance, and would receive instructions and paraphernalia
from his guardian spirit.</p>
<p>Shamanistic power could be acquired in a number of ways, not
all of which applied to each tribe being considered. A rare means
was by inheritance. If an old shaman had power and if this power
or guardian spirit liked his son or nephew, it would say &ldquo;Sometimes
I&rsquo;m going to play with that boy&rdquo; and so it goes to the boy. At sundown
the latter listens to it sing to him and he gets the power. The
boy learns about it in the vision and from the old shaman&rsquo;s instructions.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig152">
<img src="images/p44.jpg" alt="" width="449" height="501" />
<p class="pcap">Small portions of yellow hammer or red-shafted quill headbands.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>Another infrequent way to gain power was involuntarily when
seriously ill, while in a trance, or when dreaming.</p>
<p>The third and usual method of acquiring the shamanistic power
was by vision quest. It was a difficult ordeal. This might be undertaken
at various times of life, but most commonly at or near puberty.
In questing power there was no assurance of success, no matter
how sincere a person might be, or how hard he might try. Successful
shamans could quest repeatedly for additional powers.</p>
<p>Youths were prepared for questing by being lectured to by fathers
or uncles who also pierced their nose septa. Each youth went alone
and unclothed into certain portions of the mountains for several
days and nights. He slept little and fasted, eating little or nothing
at all; all flesh was taboo. The questing usually included swimming
in lakes or special pools and placing the nose piercing stick
in an underwater niche, and (Yana) securing certain bird feathers.
He built a fire, smoking his body over it, and cut himself deliberately.
If successful, the power came to him in a trance or faint
producing bleeding from the nose or mouth.</p>
<p>The guardian spirit communicated with the novice, appearing in
a vision usually. It gave instructions and taught its special ceremonial
song. To shamans of some tribes the guardian spirit looked
something like a human; to others it looked like a bug or like a
small hair. This was the &ldquo;pain&rdquo; or poison object and yet was
considered to be a guardian spirit at the same time. This is what
the novice acquired in becoming a shaman. This pain or guardian
spirit could come from any of many sources. It was alive and could
talk, and gave the novice certain resultant powers. Most commonly
powers were from animals such as coyote, bear, and the like, but
also might come from sun, moon, wind, thunder and lightning, eagle,
hawk, small birds, reptiles, frog, or oldman spirit.</p>
<p>The novice then acquired what we might call magic feathers.
There were several types including the popular salmon colored
flicker feathers. Most important, however, was the feather tuft
known as kaku among the Atsugewi. This allegedly was found
in finished form and not made. So full of power was the kaku that
it could not be kept in a house. It was placed outside securely
tied to a willow branch beside a stream or hidden inside a hollow
tree trunk. The kaku was able to move by itself so had to be tied
down or placed under a rock. When the novice shaman discovered
his kaku, the feathers were singing; when he died, blood dripped
from its feathers!</p>
<p>Upon his return to the village, the successful seeker stayed out
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
of dwelling houses for a day or two. Among some tribes he was
sick for this period. Universally he sweated and swam. Eating
habits of the novice shaman varied in different cases, but were
always as dictated by the specific instructions given to him by his
guardian spirit. Invariably all forms of flesh were shunned. He
smoked tobacco and gave his first hunting kill to an old man.
During the novice period the new shaman was helped by old shamans
at the fireside in the sweat house. He did much dancing, singing,
handled hot coals and fire, bled from the mouth, and might fall into
a trance.</p>
<p>In contrast to herbalist doctors who gave private treatment, that
of shamans was public and usually conducted indoors, preferably
in sweat lodges. The shaman needed singing help and the more
help and the more persons who attended his doctoring the better.
Sucking Shamans were the most important and required official
assistants. These included one or more interpreters to communicate
with the lay helpers or supporters, while the shaman was doctoring,
and an outside speaker to help call the shaman&rsquo;s spirits. Doctoring
could take from one to three days and nights.</p>
<p>To diagnose the patient&rsquo;s ills the shaman danced about, blowing
smoke on him, and singing with the help of the audience. The
shamans also drank water, sometimes with a tube, from portable
stone mortars with spirit power. They often squirted water from
their mouths. A whistle was used in some cases and often the
supernatural powerful cocoon rattle. Among mountain Maidu herb
medicines might be administered to the patient also.</p>
<p>At length the shaman&rsquo;s guardian spirit or pain told him the
location of the disease object, and then he could see or feel it.
Often the shaman learned further from the spirit just who it was who
had sent the disease object to plague his patient.</p>
<p>Curing the afflicted was accomplished next by the shaman&rsquo;s
sucking this pain or disease object out of some portion of the
person&rsquo;s body. The evil pain could be any curious small object
and this the shaman exhibited to all present. The malignant pain
was disposed of in a number of ways. It might be sent back to the
owner who sent it, that is, the offending shaman. Or, it might be
sent to his children who would be doomed because a shaman could
not doctor his own pain. Other times the curing shaman would
destroy the disease object by biting it and burning it or dispose of
it by taking the pain into his own charmed body.</p>
<p>When a whole community had been affected by a pain sent by
an evil shaman, the pain usually hid in the bushes nearby. In such
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
a case, the shaman had to be very powerful to
get the best of the situation. First he conducted
the ceremony of detection of one victim
in the usual sweat house manner. Once the
shaman found out where the trouble was, he
went outdoors with the villagers to help in
corraling the offending pain. Frequently only
after a lengthy search was he successful in
finding the pain and then capturing it. Upon
taking it into his body it might be so powerful
as to cause him to go into a trance. In this
event his assistants had to support him bodily,
and had to sing for him, otherwise the shaman
might die. Without wishing to appear facetious
or disparaging, it can be said that a good
shaman had to be an excellent showman as
well.</p>
<p>Sucking Shamans were obligated to accept
all cases which they were asked to treat. If
they refused any and the afflicted died, then
the shamans might be killed themselves by
relatives of the persons who succumbed. The
thinking was that if a shaman refused a case,
he must have had something to do with making
the person sick in the first place.</p>
<p>Payment was always made to the shaman.
The amount was determined by the patient&rsquo;s
relatives. They would take the offering to the
shaman when engaging him, but payment was
not made at that time. The shaman looked
over the proffered payment and might ask for more or for a different
kind of payment. To give himself a foolproof alibi in case of failure
to cure, and to increase his prestige if he did cure, he might reply
to the effect that &ldquo;The beads already have the smell of death on
them, but I&rsquo;ll see what I can do about it.&rdquo; The payment was placed
near the patient during healing treatment and was not actually
collected by the shaman if the patient died within a few weeks or
months. The shaman&rsquo;s assistants were also paid, but in lesser
amounts.</p>

</div>
<p>Besides the main function of curing, other good powers of the
shamans were the ability to foretell future events, to see what was
going on at distant places, and to locate lost or stolen articles.
Among certain tribes control of weather was also possible by Sucking
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
Shamans&mdash;among others there were special shamans with
weather power.</p>
<p>Evil powers of Sucking Shamans could cause illness or death.
This was done by talking to the pain and sending it to the victim.
The shaman might put it on the end of a willow stick and point it
at the person while singing and smoking tobacco. This could go
on all night. Transmission of the pain to the intended victim was
facilitated by contact, such as sneaking up behind him and touching
him, or by putting the disease pain in his food or under his doorstep.
The bad pain might also be dispatched by blowing it through
a pipe or putting it in the victim&rsquo;s pipe, or by talking to the
shaman&rsquo;s own animal spirit, injecting the pain into it and then sending
the animal to the victim. This power animal might just take
it to the intended person, or it might actually attack and bite him.
If the evil pain had been successfully sent, and the intended dire
results occurred, the relatives of the victim had a moral right to
kill the offending shaman, without fear of retaliation. It seems that
the culprit was usually recognized&mdash;obviously often mistakenly.
It follows that shamans&rsquo; lives were somewhat precarious, not knowing
who was going to find damning evidence against them.</p>
<p>By somewhat the same means as described above shamans could
steal a person&rsquo;s spirit or soul, rendering that person liable to
quick and sure death from the slightest accident or illness.
Shamans could be hired to perform these evil powers.</p>
<p>Singing Shamans were dreamers foretelling the future and telling
the living what their dead relatives wanted them to do. The
Singing Shaman was always male among mountain Maidu. Our other
tribes did not have this specialist, instead such powers were in
the repertoire of the Sucking Shaman.</p>
<p>Among Yana and Yahi tribes, apparently, weather doctoring
could be done by any shaman, and this was usually the case among
Atsugewi. However, mountain Maidu had specialized Weather
Shamans. These were men who were capable not only of producing
rain, snow, or hail, but also fog and high winds, or ending any of
these.</p>
<p>Rattlesnake Shamans were generally women among Atsugewi
and men among mountain Maidu. They could protect people from
rattlesnakes or cure bites. The latter was accomplished by sucking
which removed snakes and snakes&rsquo; teeth from the wound.</p>
<p>Bear Shamans did not exist among Yana tribes. Among Atsugewi
and mountain Maidu these were not specialists, instead bear power
was an additional skill of Sucking Shamans. They were almost
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
always men and pertained not to Black Bear, but only to the California
Grizzly. They wore bear skin, hair, teeth, and claws and
simulated the bear&rsquo;s actions in treating patients. Bear Shamans
were called primarily to minister to bear wounded persons from
whom they sucked out bear blood and teeth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<h2 id="c39"><span class="small">Chapter XXXVII</span>
<br />MISCELLANEOUS MAGIC</h2>
<p>All tribes of the Lassen region exercised miscellaneous more or
less supernatural powers which one might term magic.</p>
<p>Examples were: carrying a turtleshell on one&rsquo;s belt which
rendered a person immune to rattlesnake strikes, or, among Maidu
the rubbing of the root of <i>Angelica breweri</i> on the legs to keep
rattlesnakes away. Poisoning of persons could be done by some
skilled people (not shamans) by rubbing an unspecified substance
on their hands and then touching the victim&rsquo;s body; this could drive
him crazy or kill him.</p>
<p>To mountain Maidu the number five was sacred and lucky according
to Dixon.</p>

<p class="pcap">Yana charmstones and a fir twig basket container for such charms.</p>
</div>
<p>Charm stones, usually in pairs were found by many fortunate
Indians. They were smooth and rounded and were especially effective
if possessing rings or other special markings on them which
were actually surface traces of mineral veins. Quartz crystals, rare
in this volcanic region, were also highly prized as charm stones.
An ideal storage place for charm stones in their special basketry
containers was in a rattlesnake &ldquo;den&rdquo; where such snakes tended
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
to hibernate in the winter. At any rate charm stones were kept hidden
and the owner would secretly rub them on himself to gain good
luck in gambling or in other pursuits which involved much in the
way of chance.</p>

<p>Prayers for a variety of reasons were offered simply by the individual.
It was common practice every few days or so to make
token food offerings at mealtime for no specific reason. The bits
of food might be thrown to the east or into the fire.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Thus ends this resume of the customs and beliefs of the tribes
of the Lassen region&mdash;tribes virtually extinct as such today&mdash;tribes
which once lived here among the scenic beauties of Lassen
Volcanic National Park. We, the descendants of the relentless
conquerors of these local Indians, come here now to enjoy ourselves
and to refresh our bodies and spirits. As we do this on the lands
of the vanquished, we owe them not only a moment of thoughtful
reverence, but also whatever kindness and aid we are able to give
their descendants.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
